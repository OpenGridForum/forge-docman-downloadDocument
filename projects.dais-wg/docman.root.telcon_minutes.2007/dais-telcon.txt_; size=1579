- Progress and Planning

Doing a glossary and then will agree on the terms to be used for the
specifications. Roughly the plan is to:

- Finish the glossary of terms
- Agree on the terminology to be used for the specifications
- Complete the specification documents (query and ontologies)

The glossary and motivational document will be merged.

UPM and AIST are preparing an article about RDF for the CFP for OGF22
- deadline 21 Dec. The glossary will be done by the end of the year.
The combined motivational and glossary document will be available by
the 15th of January.

The ontology specification to be ready by the end of January.
The query specification to be done by the 15th of January.

Partial implementations already exist for both of these. AIST willing
to implement the ontology specification and UPM will also implement
the query specification.

In Seattle David Martin suggested that a meeting with W3C should be
organised for OGF22 in Boston - Miguel wanted to know if there was
anyone that could be contacted about this.

Dave de Roure was suggested and Dave has an ex-Oracle contact who is
now involved with W3C whose name he will pass to Miguel.

DONM: 15 or 16th of January.
