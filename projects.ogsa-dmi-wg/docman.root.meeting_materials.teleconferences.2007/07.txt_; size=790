Notes: 

Discussed about group charter
- Naming: We should change the charter to say that this is out of scope of this working group and we would be happy to work with any wg working to standardize this.

Document: Data Movement Transport Protocols and their use in OGSA-DMI

Out of scope for this spec. DMI is not about underlying data transport protocols. So we should update the charter 

Document: WS-RF Basic Profile Rendering of Data Movement Functional
Specification

Ravi will take a stab at it.
