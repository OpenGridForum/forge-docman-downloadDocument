Introduction
------------

Mario Antonioletti is one of the chairs of OGSA-DMI. Took the position
after Michel Drescher had to step down. Keen to see adoption of DMI to
take place.

Dave Meredith STFC Daresbury Laboratory - interested in DMI from the
Data Minx project and NGS perspectives.

Gerson Galang is a developer employed by VeRSI in Melbourne, and working on
the NeAT supported DataMINX project. Is contributing to developing a
standards based approach to the data transfer service being developed as a
component of the DataMINX project, and is doing so with respect to DMI and
JSDL and accordingly has been evaluating the current schemas and their
relationship to the DTS use cases. This is being done in partnership with
Dave Meredith, and builds on work undertaken in the UK with Dave Meredith in
April of this year.

Steve Crouch, from OMII-UK, pursuing this work from the JSDL
route. Have been involved with Peter, Gerson and David for a while now.

Allen Luniewski, has been with OGF for many years now. One of the
instigators for this work going on within OGF. Co-chaired the data
architecture working group that motivated DMI and has been involved in
this ever since.

Alex Arana is working with Gerson Galang on the development of a prototype
implementation of DTS, building on work undertaken in the UK with Dave
Meredith in April of this year. In particularly Alex has been developing a
prototype worker-node service for the DTS.

Peter Turner from the University of Sidney, is a crystallographer by trade,
and has interests in the application of eResearch to molecular structure
determination. These interests have led to his being involved in putting
together the DataMINX project, a federal government funded eResearch project
in essence is intended to provide data access and management services for
structure determination facilities and researchers. This includes data
transfer services for users of, for instance, the OPAL neutron source and
the Australian Synchrotron Facility. Has been discussing approaches to data
transfer with Dave Meredith for some 18 months or so, leading to work with
Dave in Australian in November 2008 and again in the UK in April this year.
The recent UK visit included discussions with Steven Crouch and Tim
Parkinson from OMII-UK, and culminated in break-out sessions at the recent
OMII collaboration workshop.

Shahbaz Memon is from FZJ and is a co-chair of the DMI working group.
He has been implementing a WSRF implementation of DMI.

DTS Progress Update
-------------------

Alex - was in the UK in late April. Attended the OMII-UK
Collaborations Workshop - got a design for a heavy lifting data moving
that will become part of the data-MINX project
(http://tinyurl.com/ppt6gr). Looked at various technologies. Came up
with the draft version of the current schema from a JSDL spec. Doing
the bits of the architecture. Have defined 3 major components:

o client - responsible for sending requests to a DTS web service
o DTS web service for managing data transfers, use JMS
o DTS worker node(s) - receive and process messages. 

Have implemented a "thin red line" - an end-to-end implementation that
satisfies the most basic use case.

Thus have a 3 tier architecture:

   DTS client ---> DTS WS ---> DTS worker node

Have JMS queues and topics for transmitting/submitting job requests.

DTS worker node are at the end - each does a unique job, DTS worker
node cloud is responsible for picking up messages. When one arrives
the DTS worker node works on this. Fulfills request. Provisions for
management of requests.

JMS good for this as it scales - can move data between different types
of protocol - SRB, ftp, etc ... add worker to process messages. Thus
JMS - allows for horizontal scaling. Lots of flexibility in how you
confer the jobs through JMS.

Protocol between client and server is SOAP.
Interested in a document/literal approach.

Want to be able to express multiple data transfers within one requests
and manage these from one service.

In email correspondence ahead of the telecon, Gerson Galang had noted that
the prototype work was providing a basis for evaluating the relevance of
JSDL and DMI to the proposed DTS, and then to identify any need to request
extensions or changes to these standards.

David Meredith has put in a DMI extension proposal to use a wrapped data
transfer request that could encapsulate multiple pairwise sources and sinks
as a starting position to be able to do this:

http://www.ogf.org/pipermail/ogsa-dmi-wg/2009-June/000488.html

At the moment DMI cannot handle multiple transfers from one
service instance. This would be an extension to the existing
functionality but probably needs some refinement.

There was some question as to the nature of these. If one transaction 
fails will the whole data transfer fail? Is it best effort? How do
you cope with the lack of transactional support for file operations
in most OSs? There are a large number of questions that need to
be addressed.

The other proposal within the mail message to add extensibility points
to various elements seemed acceptable.

Mario was in favour of trying to modify the spec accordingly if
it would increase uptake/adoption. Need to think carefully about
what the implication of any changes will be though and see what
the processes are.

Peter Turner noted a real world use case for providing support to enable
transfers from multiple sources. At least occasionally a researcher will
visit for instance a synchrotron facility and use more than one technique or
beamline, and would then want to transfer all of the data back home as one
'job'. Dave Meredith agreed that this was a use case of interest.

Planning
--------

Mario will try to contact with the OGF editor to see how easy it will
be to put changes through. Allen will check to see whether a number of
distinct directories can be transferred from one source using a single
request to a DTF (and thus managed by a single DTI). All to look at
and comment on David's proposal and see how/whether they can be
improved.

Date of next call: 8am  UK time (GMT+1), 13 July 2009
