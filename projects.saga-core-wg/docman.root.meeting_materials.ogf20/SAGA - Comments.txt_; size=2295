SAGA - Public Comments
Sunflower: 14:00-15:30 Monday 29th January 2007
Goal: Overview of the public comments made on the API.

[AD] Workshop and All Hands-On presentation.

Q: Can we have an overview of the API?
A: Two persons request it. The presentation is shifted to the next SAGA session.

Overview of Kaiser's Comments.

Overview of Kleijer's Comments.
Discussion on the state machine and "Unknown" state. Language binding might have additional information about how the state is used.

Usage of Proxy Gates for streams. The consensus is to let it to the language binding and not within the API. Another mechanism has to be used.

Overview of Illingworth's Comments.

Overview of Pipan's Comments.
Q: Life time of the default session. How do we handle it?  
A: Get created as needed, gets destroyed on application shutdown.

Q: What is the purpose of adding a task to task_container more than once?
A: Nothing presents it.

Q: What happen when 3 files copy on the same job is done?
A: Depends on the implementation and how the job is handled on the back-end. 

Conclusion:
A task can only be added once to a container. The "add" will be silently ignored if added more then once.

Q: Discussion on the error handling and error list vs. single error messages. 
A: No we should stay as is now.

Q: Should the automatic conversion of a string to an array be there?
A: To simplify the API no, the conversion to list or arrays should not be automatic.

Q: Byte ordering important?
A: We have only streams of bytes and files of bytes, thus no problem.
TODO: Ensures that the API properly state that we have stream of bytes and file of bytes.

Problem of having the attribute interface not supporting the asynchronous interface. The case is replica management where attribute are stored on the back-end.
Conclusion: The attribute interface will implement the asynchronous interface. (This is ugly but necessary).

Q: Should SAGA add a byte buffer class to handle streams, files, messages etc?
A: Yes, the API should be changed to support only bytes and add a Byte Buffer class.

API final submission for OGF 20. The document will be submitted end of March 2007.

What to submit:
- Clean New
- Commented New
