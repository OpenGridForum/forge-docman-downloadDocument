SAGA - Language Bindings
Sunflower: 16:00-17:30 Monday 29th January 2007
Goal: Discuss the Java Language bindings

Since several Java bindings are on track it becomes mandatory to define the L&F of the bindings to avoid diverging implementations.

Illingworth's Presentation:
JRA7 and SAGA from DEISA.
Q: Why is there a SAGAException
A: Because this is typical of a JAVA implementation.

Q: Why are some namespace methods with arrays of flags and not bit set?
A: Check with the implementation guys for the reason.

Q: Was it straightforward or tricky to apply the API?
A: Not really. 

Kleijer's Presentation:
Raised issues in the current specification to rectify: Support of all JSDL attributes
Problems of interpretation of the API document: not clear on how some object must be used.
Strong need to uniform the API L&F in Java.

Q: How do we do a Java implementation reference document?
A: Setup a repository to define each SAGA Java API and converge to a JAVA binding.

HPC Profiles might be a good extension to SAGA use cases. It might also provide some insight of the needs for application level.
