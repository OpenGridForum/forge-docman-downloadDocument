JSDL Teleconference - 18 June 2008
==================================

* Participants

  Philipp Wieder
  Andreas Savva (minutes)
  Alexander Papaspyrou
  Donal Fellows
  Michel Drescher

* Review of OGF23 session

  - Visualization/steering use case: having the Activity EPR available
    in some manner is ok. Donal keeps the action for now.
  - Two main issues raised in the session
    - Modeling static or dynamic information
    - Whether the scope is that of the BES activity only
      - Need to review BES activity model in more detail
      - Rough consensus that it is ok to do more than the BES Activity
        as long as it is clear what is extra

      ACTION: Andreas and Philipp to read with BES specification and
              identify activity content

      - Reminder that Andreas has a similar action for the DMI
        specification (instance)

  - With gridforge down agreed to track issues in the document for
    now (Philipp)

* Informal discussion on static vs dynamic content
  - Make clear distinction between dynamic / static information; and
    maybe static information is updated less frequently; perhaps
    available from different services/containers
  - UDAP did static information mainly; but that work was done in a
    specific context with knowledge of the kind of information
    produced; dynamic from same interface
  - Could provide last recorded state (with timestamp) as dynamic
    information, with some other small set 
  - All information (including dynamic) has to be considered
    out-of-date on arrival; that's the nature of distributed
    systems. (Static probably means information that may impact
    performance if retrieved frequently)
  - Opinions seem to lean towards tackling static information mainly;
    but it is too early to make a clear decision

* Next call scheduled for July 2

* JSDL 1.0 Experience draft review

  ACTION: Andreas to ask survey repondents whether they agree to have
          their survey responses included in the document

  Alexander agreed to included the C3G response.
