** Confirm teleconf slot for future calls

  New time slot seems ok. It will move an hour for UK & Europe after
  the change to summer time. US (already changed) and Japan (no
  change) stay the same.

** Next call

   - Andreas and Steve are not available March 27.
   - Andreas will check if there is enough material for a call next
     week.
   - Possible next date otherwise is Apr.2. 
     - Andreas is not available; Steve will decide if there is a call
   - Apr.9 is the next firm date for a call.

* Parameter Sweep

** Parameter sweep value from file 
   - Need more information on specifics; the wiki can be used for
     this.
   - Once there is sufficient information arrange to discuss this on
     a teleconference.

** Non-integer or negative integer values
   - Float as values in sweeps was discussed before; issue seems to
     have the accuracy of representation. (?)
   - Could allow negative integer and positive for step values; it can
     be defined in the schema
   - Geoff should put issues in the tracker for discussion/tracking

** Tracker issues discussed and updates directly in tracker
