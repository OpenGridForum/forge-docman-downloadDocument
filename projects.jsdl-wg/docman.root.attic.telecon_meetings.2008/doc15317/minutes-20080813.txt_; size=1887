Tracker:
  https://forge.gridforum.org/sf/tracker/do/listArtifacts/projects.jsdl-wg/tracker.parameter_sweep

* artf6148: Geoff will reformulate for next week
* artf6264: File sweep
  - Text looks well written; will include in the next draft.
  - Mandate a specific delimiter or not?
    - Agreed that it is best to leave the delimiter choice up to the
      user. Change the schema accordingly.
  - Support regular expressions? No

  - David will update the draft.
  - Michel will merge in the document. The document requires some
    additional reorganization to move examples in an Appendix and so
    forth.

* artf6187: Constraint
  - A number of concerns with the effort that might be required to
    define this: a constraint language (or at least defining a subset
    of another language such as XPath) is needed; still unsure what is
    the best way to define this in XML.
  - Also how far to go with variable scoping and the danger to turning
    this all into a general programming language...
  
  Agreed to defer for a later version or extension. But will provide
  appropriate extensibility in the current spec so that it would not
  have to be modified if we add this later.
  - Added artf6269 and assigned to Michel; review next week.

* Other issues:
** Draft 11: Removed attributegroup from loopdouble definition due to
   tooling issues.

* Michel has the pen 
* Andreas took over review and closing of 'fixed' artifacts: 6147,
  6184, 6150, 6151, 6145, etc.


* Next call 

  It is an Activity but will arrange 15 minutes or so at the beginning
  for parameter sweep to resolve artf6269
