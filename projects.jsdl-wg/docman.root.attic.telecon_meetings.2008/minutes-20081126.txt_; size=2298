* Timeslot & Frequency of calls: stay with 1pm UTC and bi-weekly 

* Parameter Sweep public comment discussion

** Double value comparison
   - Proposal to reformulate as explicit loop counts and exceptions on
     loop counts.
   - Discussed whether this is user-friendly or not. The typical
     counter-argument is that the schemas are not for human
     consumption and a user interface could help out by generating the
     exceptions automatically, etc.
   - Accuracy did not seem to be an issue to early implementors. Java
     bigdecimal (java.math.bigdecimal) seemed to have no issues. But
     this is probably not behaviour that can be relied on for all
     implementations.

   Initial consensus: Probably ok to do loopcount and exception for
   double loops. Do need to do some background checks (ask
   implementors) and discuss again.
   
   Action: Ask parameter sweep early implementors if they have
           implemented loopdouble and what issues they have
           - g-eclipse (Andreas)
           - KISTI (David)
           - Nimrod (Geoff)

   Action: David to ask Stephen Pickles to come to the next call

** Zero-step
   - This was discussed when the spec was written and the consensus
     was that it was overkill to do it in schema. There is no reason
     to change that decision.

** XPath substring

   - Does it return the string or node for substring match?
     - string is returned; we expect the node
   - Is it (easily) implementable? Need to check whether anyone has
     actually implemented it.
   - The use case for identifying input/output files for sweep
     instances depends on this feature, so it would be nice to keep in
     the spec if possible.
   
   Action: Ask parameter sweep early implementors if they have
           implemented the substring match and what issues they have
           - g-eclipse (Andreas)
           - kisti (David)
           - Nimrod (Geoff)

* Next call: December 10th @ 1pm UTC
