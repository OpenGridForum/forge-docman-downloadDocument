JSDL Teleconference - 12 November 2008
======================================

* Participants

  Fred Brisard 
  Andreas Savva (minutes)
  Philipp Wieder

* Review of Activity document draft

  http://forge.gridforum.org/sf/docman/do/viewDocument/projects.jsdl-wg/docman.root.working_drafts.activity_schema/doc15395/2

  This will probably be split (eventually) into two documents

  - Main text is still a stub
  - Appendix A: Use cases and some notes
  - Appendix B: Consolidated requirements

** Walkthrough of Appendix B

   - Workflow issue: Need to clarify how it relates to this work;
     can't take too much on this for a variety of reasons, not all
     technical.
   - How states and substates relate to BES state model needs
     discussion.
   - Do records only get created for a state change? Probably not,
     some examples that might not fit very well: VM migration
     scenario, checkpointing.
   - Terminology: 'Final' record may not be final; implementations
     could choose to 're-start' an activity. 'Aggregate' or some other
     term may be better.
     - Agreed that 'sealing' is implementation-dependent
   - Access control ... is implementation dependent. Do have to
     provide some security discussion in the document.
   - Granularity ... again is implementation-dependent
   - Exceptions ... out of scope

Action: Philipp to update requirements and do survey on
        relative priorities

* Next call: Two weeks time, 11/26
