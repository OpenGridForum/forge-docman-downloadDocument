JSDL Teleconference - 16 July 2008
===================================

* Participants

  Fred Brisard
  Michel Drescher
  Donal Fellows
  David Meredith
  Andreas Savva

  Apologies: Steve McGough, Geoff Williams
  Minutes: Andreas Savva

* Summary of decisions

   - Agreed that making Parameter/function abstract seems to solve the
     main problem of how to specify the file template extension
   - Agreed that the JsdlElement concrete definition should be in the
     jsdl-sweep.xsd so that the main specification is standalone and
     independent of the file template extension

* Summary of actions

   - ACTION: David Meredith to rework the examples in the wiki and
             update the file template schema/defintion
   - ACTION: Michel Drescher to update the main parameter sweep
             specification with the abstract definitions

* Parameter Sweep: Issues
** File Sweeping Proposal 

   - Reviewed proposal on wiki by David Meredith and Geoff Williams
   http://forge.gridforum.org/sf/wiki/do/viewPage/projects.jsdl-wg/wiki/ParameterSweepExtensionInputFileSweeping2

   - The proposal is based on making the Parameter and Function
     abstract in jsdl-sweep.xsd schema and then providing concrete
     definitions in parameters.xsd

   - Reviewed examples. Some of the discussion/comments 
     - If assign=false then use the "default=" value
       - Suggested that there is no need for both assign and default
         if the value is only used when assign=true
       - 'static' instead of 'default' or maybe just 'assign' as
         alternative naming; or
       - just as an outerloop with a single value; or
       - a function that returns always the same value; or
       - preprocessing files to get the static definitions
     - 'default' attribute was suggested as an addition to the main
       sweep schema at OGF23 but it is not clear if it makes sense
       there since in the non-file template case all values are
       provided

   - Since the template data file is modified there is a question on
     how to ensure that the original file can be used before each
     sweep instance. One way is to require a data staging element to
     appear. Discussed whether it should be mandated or recommended
     with the rough consensus towards recommending.

   - Naming of xsd file? Parameter or Target or ...
     - perhaps file-sweep.xsd

   - Is extensibility on elements (xsd:any) necessary or not (as in
     the GFD.56)
     - Need clearer understanding of the use case for this kind of
       extensibility for the sweep spec given its much narrower scope

   - How to support different sets of substitutions within the same
     file? 
     - Not addressed but seems like a needed use case. 
     - Perhaps define as two different sets with the same template
       file and then define that in such a case the changes have to be
       merged. 


   - Agreed that making Parameter/function abstract seems to solve the
     main problem of how to specify the file template extension
   - Agreed that the JsdlElement concrete definition should be in the
     jsdl-sweep.xsd so that the main specification is standalone and
     independent of the file template extension


   - ACTION: David Meredith to rework the examples in the wiki and
             update the file template schema/defintion
   - ACTION: Michel Drescher to update the main parameter sweep
             specification with the abstract definitions

* Next call 

   - Next parameter call scheduled for July 30th
   - Next call (July 23th) will probably be on Activity schema
     (pending confirmation)
