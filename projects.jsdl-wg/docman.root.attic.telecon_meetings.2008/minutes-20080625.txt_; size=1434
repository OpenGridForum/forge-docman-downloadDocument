* Parameter Sweep
** OGF23 review
   - Summary of conclusion of OGF23 parameter sweep session sent to
     the list is fine
** Input files extension discussion
   - It is not essential to have the extension written up for the main
     Parameter sweep specification to be submitted for public
     comment. But it is necessary to know how the extension can be
     formulated and to make any changes necessary to accomodate it
     before submitting
  - David will update the wiki with the schema of the extension
    proposal
  - Geoff proposed making the parameter type abstract as one
    possibility
     - Location together with Placeholder should be abstracted into
       the Parameter
  - Action: Michel/David/Geoff to produce a proposal for the Abstract
            Parameter by next call

** Review of remaining issues
*** Loop names/values
   - artf6183: Closed as it is the same as artf6184
   - artf6184: Agreed to two loops (Integer, Double). Geoff will do
     the writeup.

** Next parameter call
   - Scheduled for July 9th
   - Likely to move the time by one hour later to accomodate US
     Pacific coast participants
