* Status update
** JSDL Errata release is now out of public comment. A single comment
   on checking the file examples.
** Noted OGF23 deadlines; early registration deadline is April 11.
** Parameter sweep update Geoff has uploaded a number of
   issues/suggestions to the tracker and wiki. These will be discussed
   on the next parameter sweep call, probably in two weeks time. He
   has also been following up with a contact at Nimrod as well as with
   Kisti.

* Use cases for activity schema

  Discussed the three use cases/set of requirements sent to the list 

** Scheduling use case
   - http://www.ogf.org/pipermail/jsdl-wg/2008-April/000992.html and
        https://forge.gridforum.org/sf/go/doc15178?nav=1

   This is actually a set of use cases consisting of multiple
   scenarios. Activity template submitted to the primary scheduler is
   JSDL. This is probably also what is submitted to the secondary
   scheduler but with some additional information, e.g., a reference
   to the Activity instance(conceptually only one), created to track
   the information.
   - For provenance purposes would have to record the delegation to the
     secondary scheduler. The detailed schema for this would not in
     scope; only the definition of a 'container' in the top level
     Activity schema

** Unicore etc
   - http://www.ogf.org/pipermail/jsdl-wg/2008-April/000991.html

   A set of requirements; the first two from Unicore use cases. The
   next two are along the lines of the Platform use case---recording
   information at certain events or state transitions, including
   failure conditions.

** Platform
   - http://www.ogf.org/pipermail/jsdl-wg/2008-April/000989.html

   Monitoring/tracking information including resource usage
   information over the job's lifetime.

   Agreed that consistency or storage/caching methods of the activity
   information is out of scope of the schema work. Access mechanisms
   are also not in immediate scope of the schema work; did note the
   various possibilities of accessing, including querying a BES
   container.

** Conclusion

  Agreed to do a more consistent writeup using a common template, and
  to keep things simple and brief. Some high-level UML is ok, but
  there is no need to go to the level of sequence diagrams. It is NOT
  a target to create an OGF document out of these use cases. Just to
  identify and document requirements. So the wiki might be the place
  where these are stored eventually.

  ACTION: Andreas will check the Glue use case template and see if it
          can be used here.

  Target for OGF23 is to identify and list the requirements from the
  use cases.

* Next call

  - In two weeks time: April 23. 
  - A separate announcement will be sent to the list.
