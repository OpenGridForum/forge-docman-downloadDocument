1. JSDL Experience document
2. OGF20 wrap up
3. 1.0 Errata document

JSDL Experience document
------------------------
- Rumour has it that if a spec in OGF comes along for 2 years without an 
  Experience document, then the spec is getting obsolete.
- JSDL 1.0 is approaching the 2 year deadline, and we need to check whether
  this applies to us or not
- The group agrees that an Experience document is really overdue and that
  we should create one soon, even possibly before the next HPC07 end of this 
  year.
- The group agrees on compiling the Experience document into one document 
  instead of several.
- The group agrees that at least GridSAM and UNICORE should directly contribute
  to this document, but not without not mentioning all the other participants
  of the great HPC06 interop demo.
- Alternatively the group provides a form implementers could fill in and return
  to the Experience Document editors.
- AI Andreas: Review the requirements of an OGF Experience document, and provide
              an outline of an Experience document.

OGF20 wrap up
-------------
- Based on the OGF20 session, the next pieces of work would be:

-- JSDL 1.0 Errata document

-- One JSDL 1.0 extension document profiling XQuery 
 --- Use different query languages?
 --- Need to narrow down the XQuery features we would want to allow
 --- We need to be aware of namespaces and different data models
	 ---- Do we need to provide explicitly the used data model?
	 ---- Should we allow/disallow expressions that can be used against
		  multiple data models?
 --- The group tends to see this as an extension document rather than a
	 profile document. However, the document even when written as an extension
	 document must state that this document is at the same time a profile
	 on XQuery / XPath
 --- Contributors shall be:
	 Michel, Steve McGough

-- Parameter Sweep
   --- The group would like to see this document as a working group draft
   --- Andreas has created a Parameter Sweep tracker

-- JSDL Instance document / Activity document
   --- We need to set up a wiki page collecting the efforts and requirements
       for this
