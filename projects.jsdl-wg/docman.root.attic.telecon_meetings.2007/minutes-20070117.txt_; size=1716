  -- Its use is discouraged using SHOULD NOT normative term in JSDL 1.1
  -- Extensibility mechanism should be used instead
- art5647: "Memory resources need clarification"
  -- The configured memory is meant
  -- This does not provide for querying for "free" memory (how is "free 
     memory" defined anyway?)
- art5652: "Well known filesystem names"
  -- The filesystem type must be made normative for the well known file systems
  -- Other characteristics should be given informatively
  -- ROOT definition need to be re-considered
- art5648: "Disk space resources"
  -- Single-disk case is solved
  -- Multi-disk case needs clarification for IndividualDiskSpace element
