JSDL Teleconference - 19 December 2007
======================================

* Participants

  Donal Fellows
  Andreas Savva
  Philipp Wieder
  Fred Brisard
  Steve McGough
  
  Minutes: Andreas Savva

* OGF22 sessions

  The deadline for the session proposals is still TBA on the OGF22
  site. So this discussion was postponed for the next call/meeting.
  
  A number of participants will be at Imperial from Jan.9-11 and this
  seems a good opportunity to plan the sessions.

  At the last OGF it was agreed that the group would decide whether to
  keep the Activity/instance work in JSDL-WG or go for a new
  group. There are pros and cons to either approach and it was agreed
  to postpone the decision till the next meeting.
  
  ACTION: Steve and Andreas will arrange a meeting during
          Jan.9-11 to discuss the OGF22 sessions; Philipp will
          participate by phone/skype

* Activity schema requirements (cont.)

  Discussed UDAP documents now available on gridforge

** Use cases: https://forge.gridforum.org/sf/go/doc14967?nav=1

   Discussed definition of Activity and agreed that it is broadly
   acceptable and along the lines of BES. The definition in the
   document has a NextGRID perspective since it makes a distinction
   between activity(atomic) and workflow. Other projects/groups might
   also think of a workflow itself represented as an activity.
   
   It was pointed out that thinking about 'activity' as 'instance' (as
   compared to JSDL 'template') is probably clearer; and in fact the
   session at OGF21 was named along those lines (initially).

   Agreed to use the BES definition of Activity since that is already
   published in an OGF document, while keeping in mind the more
   general concepts. (The eventual goal is not just computational
   activities.)

** Schema: https://forge.gridforum.org/sf/go/doc14968?nav=1

   - All the top-level structure was implemented by NextGRID. But not
     necessarily all of the substructures.
   - The 'Dialect' attribute appears only on ActivityDescription but
     it should also appear on other xsd:any elements.
     - String type for this does not seem correct
   - State values are modeled after BES. But probably an intermediate
     draft was used because the published BES spec uses different
     values. In any case it is probably better to avoid duplication
     and instead refer to other specifications as needed: if the BES
     spec is referenced by the element then its definitions are used;
     and so on. (It was also suggested that to base generic top level
     definitions off the Reference Model instead.)
   - The values in Dependency may be dynamic and updated over the
     lifetime of the activity
   - The meaning of 'Resource' depends on the context or point of
     view. For NextGRID this element contained the JSDL document since
     it was used to specify the resources needed by the activity
     - As a corollary the ActivityDescription does not necessarily
       contain a JSDL document. The intention is that it could
       describe more than a job schema.
   - There is no element to keep a record of the resources consumed by
     the Activity.  This is a missing piece in the spec. The 'results'
     element is not meant for this.
   - Context: May contain the SLA or a reference to the SLA. Security
     characteristics may be from the viewpoint of who can access or
     manage which parts of the Activity, rather than which credentials
     the Activity has.
   - Since the UDAP spec is open to the content that goes in each
     element it was suggested that a top level udap element could be
     introduced to describe which specifications or profiles are
     used/implemented by the Activity (e.g., HPC Profile, security
     profiles, etc)
   - Chronological information (date/time records) is used to relate
     different parts of the UDAP elements. This was good enough.
   - Record could contain a snapshot of the activity or a pointer to a
     snapshot

   NextGRID implemented this Activity specification using WSRF and a
   resource oriented perspective (WS-Resource) comes through. Philipp
   also mentioned other implementations.

   It was suggested to hold a session at the next OGF on instance
   descriptions, inviting projects to describe their implementations
   for maintaining this kind of information, including how much
   dynamic information is captured. It is not clear how to convince
   projects to join such a session though.

* Review of jsdl use case text for ogsa information model architecture
  - Postponed for next meeting

* AOB - None
