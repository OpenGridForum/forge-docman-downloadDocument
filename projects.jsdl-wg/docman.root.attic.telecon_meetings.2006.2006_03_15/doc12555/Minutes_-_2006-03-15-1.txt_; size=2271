Parallel Job Type Extension

   - Fujitsu (Andreas Savva - ?)
   - LeSC, Imperial College (Stephen McGough/William Lee - ?)


 - Comments:
   ---------
-> Donal - Need full doc examples of how the parallel extension would be used as a starting point
         - Example of the features in the BSC proposal within the context of an overall JSDL doc

   Andreas - We could use examples of parallel jobs being used within the context of JSDL
   Andreas - Get parallel job extension examples from NAREGI
   Ivan - Send examples of parallel jobs from BSC to the JSDL-WG mailing-list
   Leo - Get Chris to send us intention of collaboration with the parallel extension examples
   Andreas - Chris has sent topology examples to JSDL list in the past, will dig them out

 - Actions:
   --------
   [Ivan] - Send BSD parallel job examples using JSDL and extensions to the list
   [Andreas] - Seek out NAREGI parallel job examples using JSDL and extensions and send to the list
   [Andreas/Chris] - Send parallel job topology examples using JSDL and extensions to the list


Working with CDDLM in Provisioning
----------------------------------
 o Chris' BLAST job example in JSDL with CDDLM deployment doc 
   - examples are being discussed and worked on in OGSA
   - ball is in OGSA's court to sort out use-cases and architectural requirements
   - Andreas will warn on ball returning to JSDL-WG
