Agenda & Minutes
----------------

 5) Section 3 (spec doc) general revision and polishing up

    --> On Going

    --> Action: Ali


 6) Update explanation for jsdl:other usage

    - jsdl:other is the value for e.g. other arch and OS name etc.

    - Have defined this and behaviours - have to be able to process it and 
      must reject the document if can't be processed.

    - To add extra information that is allowed to be ignored if can't be 
      processed, but, jsdl:any can't be ignored.

    - Section 4.2 - placeholder (maybe better in the Extending JSDL section).

    - "JSDL consumers must be able to understand and implement ALL job
      requirements, even extensions, for the elements that they support."

    --> On Going

    --> Action: Andreas to update spec with Michel and Steve's text and 
                add above statement re: support for extensions.


 8) JSDL compliance levels
    How much of JSDL a system must support, not just process.
    Probably a topic for later.

    - Placeholder, will come up later!

    - Michel's e-mail to the list:
    http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/jsdl-wg/2005/04/msg00111.html

    - Ali's e-mail to the list:
    http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/jsdl-wg/2005/05/msg00007.html

    - Part of Ali's suggested text for Section 2 (see e-mail at above URL):

      "The key word support, with respect to a JSDL consuming system 
      supporting the JSDL specification and the language constructs, refers 
      to the ability of that system to parse a JSDL document.  That is, 
      the consuming system must be able to interpret the language constructs 
      and assign to them the semantics described in this specification and 
      the values assigned to them in that JSDL document. All JSDL 
      consuming systems must, therefore, support all of the JSDL 
      language constructs."

    - For post-v1.0 - Add to Ali's text:

      "A JSDL consumer that supports JSDL but cannot satisfy ALL the 
      job requirements in a JSDL document, MUST NOT instantiate a job 
      from that document."

    --> On Going

    --> Action: Andreas to update section 2.


 9) The statement "If not supported then the consuming system MUST reject
    the document." needs a bit more explanation or re-write.

    - Refer to Notational Conventions.

    [see  number 8 above]


11) Filesystem name and type and filesystem reference in DataStaging

    - This needs to be specified? Needs more explanation?

    - FileSystemID changed to FileSystemName
    - Define well known filesystem names: HOME and TMP

    - Donal's e-mails to the list:
    http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/jsdl-wg/2005/05/msg00006.html
    http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/jsdl-wg/2005/05/msg00008.html

    - Action: Andreas

    --> On Going


12) MountPoint environment variable. Is the current approach ok, or
    should we provide a separate mechanism, e.g., a tag that if present
    provides the name of the environment variable in which the
    MountPoint value must be present.

    - If a Mountpoint environment variable is not specified, then the name 
      of the filesystem is used for the value of the env var.

    - Action: Andreas

    --> On Going

    [linked to number 11 above]


14) DRMAA use case for defining filenames. We have to at least be able
    to show an example of how to define and stage out an <Output> file.

    - Action: Andreas

    --> On Going

    [linked to number 11 above]


16) Process Topology needs review. In particular are the examples ok or
    not, are the definition correct and so on. Delete the yellow
    comments once that is done. Not sure if we should define the precise
    allocation behaviour or allow for that to be defined instead.

    - Action: ALL to review this section (Section 6 in 0.9.5-01).
        - ProcessCount to be put back into POSIX Application.
        - ProcessCountLimit in the POSIX Application.

    - Karl's e-mail to the list:
    http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/jsdl-wg/2005/04/msg00151.html

    - Karl: recommends an attribute on the <resource> element to describe the 
      requirement for a "4 CPU machine" vs. "4 CPUs on A machine".

    --> On Going

    - Action: Andreas and Karl to address this on the mailing list.


17) Section "Extending JSDL" needs an owner. I expect this section to be
    about 1 page long so should not be too much trouble.

    [see  number 6 above]


19) Re-check terminology for process topology and delete comments

    [see  number 16 above]


31) Complete example sub-sections

    - Need examples for elements.

    --> On Going
