Dear All,

The next JSDL phone meeting is tomorrow at 16:00 GMT (17:00 European Time 
and 08:00 PST). Please note that this is an hour earlier than the previous
meetings.

The preliminary agenda is,

JSDL WG phone meeting Agenda - 19/03/03, 16:00 GMT
--------------------------------------------------
o Review the minutes from the two GGF7 meetings. 
o Approve minutes.
o Review the charter in light of the comments raised
o AOB   

The minutes from the BoF are attached to this e-mail. I will post the
minutes from the other (unofficial) meeting first thing tomorrow.

Please post any issues you wish to discuss to the mailing list and I'll
include them in the agenda.

My apologies to our Far East participants for the time of the 
meeting. Please can you let me know if you're interested in joining the 
phone meetings (I know at least one person who is) and we can arrange 
additional meetings (or are there any other solutions?).

Look forward to having you online tomorrow.

Cheers,

Ali (, Steve, Darren)
