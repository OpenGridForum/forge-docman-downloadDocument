All,

We are planning to hold a phone meeting for the JDSL group on Wednesday at
16:00 GMT (08:00 PST). Details for how to participate will follow shortly.

The plan is to revise the charter in light of the comments raised at the BoF
held at GGF7 and the comments from the area directors.

You can find a current copy of the charter along with the minutes from the
BoF on the group webpage:
http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/~ali/WORK/GGF/JSDL-WG/
(The current charter is also at the end of this email.)

The parts of the charter that we are intending to revise are:
- Adding a definition of what we mean by a job.
- Defining how much the group will take on the area of workflow.
- Define that we intend to produce an XML implementation of the JDSL.
- There may be some need to split the JSDL into two WG the first to survey
the current state of play the second to develope the new description
language. This point needs to be discussed within the group and then with the
GGF steering group.
- Make sure we reference all groups that we will interact with.

If people have other issues they feel we should discuss about the charter
could they please let Darren, Ali or myself know. Either before or during the
meeting.

Many thanks and hope to see you there,

steve..
