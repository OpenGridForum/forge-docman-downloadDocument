JSDL Telecon Agenda - 17th Sept. 2003
-------------------------------------

o Plan of action for the spec doc.

  - must change previous plan, which was to

      * scope requirements,
      * survey various batch systems,
      * write spec.

  - perhaps can start with an existing language and schema?

      * RSL (from Globus)
      * JDML (from EDG)
      * Condor ClassAds (from Condor!)
      * others possibilities to start with?

  - then can address the deficiencies and extras in the language that 
    we have choosen as a starting point, in order to attempt to construct 
    a JSDL that can serve as an abstract job description language.


o GGF9 Sessions.

  - Introduction slides (Ali to draft)

  - Spec Doc slides (Don't know what these should be until 
    we have a better idea of the structure of the spec.)

  Session 2:
  ----------

  - 3 talks:

      * WS-Agreement framework
      * Program Execution Architecture (based on Grid Services)
      * Job description terms within the WS-Agreement framework
