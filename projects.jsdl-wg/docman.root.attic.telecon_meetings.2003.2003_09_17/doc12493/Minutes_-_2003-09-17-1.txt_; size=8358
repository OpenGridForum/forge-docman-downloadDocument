Agenda:
=======

1. Plan of action for the spec doc

  - must change previous plan, which was to

      * scope requirements,
      * survey various batch systems,
      * write spec.

  - perhaps can start with an existing language and schema?

      * RSL (from Globus)
      * JDML (from EDG)
      * Condor ClassAds (from Condor!)
      * others possibilities to start with?

  - then can address the deficiencies and extras in the language that 
    we have chosen as a starting point, in order to attempt to construct 
    a JSDL that can serve as an abstract job description language.


2. GGF9 Sessions

  Session 1:
  ----------

  - Introduction slides (Ali to draft)

  - Spec Doc slides (Don't know what these should be until 
    we have a better idea of the structure of the spec.)

  Session 2:
  ----------

  - 3 talks to lead discussion on:

      * WS-Agreement framework
      * Program Execution Architecture (based on Grid Services)
      * Job description terms within the WS-Agreement framework

Steve M.: Section 5 is missing a section on the requirements of I/O and file 
          access and manipulation requirements.
Ali: Will add this in.


Jim P.: stated that WS-Agreement in itself can satisfy requirements under 
        Sections 5.1.1, 5.1.8, and 6
Ali: made the point that the JSDL will benefit from providing a 
     comprehensive and self contained set of attributes and features.
     This is particularly important in cases where the Grid Services Arch 
     is not being employed and/or use is not being made of the WS-Agreement 
     framework.

It was generally agreed that the JSDL structure should satisfy both the 
Agreement framework in terms of the Agreement terms architecture, _as well 
as_ a more general architecture. Since JSDL will be implemented in, e.g. 
XML, it is easy to ignore any Agreement Framework attributes that a non Grid 
Service, or Agreement based, system cannot comply with. In short, it is 
better at this stage to satisfy the Agreement framework and have more than 
that requires.


Jim P.: GGF explicitly requires a section on security considerations. This 
        could sit between sections 6 and 7.
Ali: Will add this in.


Steve M.: There's a section missing on the details of the structure of the 
          JSDL, e.g. detail such as if attribute values are expressed as 
          Strings or complex types etc. and the motivations behind this.
          This could sit between sections 4 and 5.
Ali: Will add this in.


Jim: The normative XML Schema should be appended at the end of the document 
     as an Appendix.
Ali: Notice that's the case with OGSI spec. Since the JSDL charter promises 
     the delivery of a separate normative XML schema doc, however, we should 
     pose the question on the list, or at GGF9.


Hiro: Section 4 specifically targets Computational Grid jobs. Why not other 
      types of jobs too? There's a much wider scope to jobs, why not a JSDL 
      for this larger scope.
Ali: It has previously been agreed that the scope of the JSDL is to focus on 
     conventional batch system jobs, i.e. computational jobs on 
     Computational Grids. Although any "job" can be defined in terms of the 
     target executable, and input and output data, e.g. and SQL query, it is 
     premature to widen the scope of the JSDL, at this stage, to include 
     "just about any" kind of job. The starting point with focus on current 
     batch systems, should already begin to answer many questions regarding 
     how one might want to describe "just about any" kind of job.

Resolution was to float this question onto the list again for discussion. 
This question has also been raised by An Ly of CA on the JSDL list 
previously (ref 9th July 2003, also see response from Ali to this).


Discussion of plan of attack
----------------------------

Ali: expressed that at the GGF7 BoF session of JSDL, we had a logical 
     progression of three deliverables, Requirements Doc, Systems' Survey 
     Doc, and the final JSDL spec. This was changed in the light of the 
     requirement on the WG to produce a single clear and concise JSDL spec 
     as the main deliverable. So how do we tackle the work? Will the group 
     agree to start on a platform provided by a currently existing language 
     or schema?
Alain A.: There's a "Job Terms Proposal" being developed and being made ready
          for imminent submission to GGF. This work is a collaboration 
          between Globus and Platform, and addresses a core set of Job 
          description attributes as surveyed from the LSF, PBS, SGE, and RSL 
          system languages. This is to be submitted for discussion (possibly
          at the JSDL-WG session) at GGF9.
Ali: Stated that, speaking for himself, he'd like the document discussed at 
     the second GGF9 JSDL-WG session as a dissemination activity for it to 
     be discussed in order to find out whether it can be built on for JSDL.
     Also, that this must first be discussed with Steve M. and Darren 
     Pulsipher as the joint chairs of the JSDL-WG.
Steve M.: has no objections to discussing the Job Terms Proposal at GGF9.

Ali: stated that EPCC has an ongoing activity to produce a set of common 
     terms, that can also be fed into the JSDL spec. SGE, Loadleveler, RSL,
     and Condor, are the systems currently under scrutiny.

Hiro: stated that Andreas Savva is working on the abstraction of the Unicore
      system language.

It was generally agreed that it is a good idea to start from an existing 
work and build on top of that to produce the JSDL.


Discussion of EDG JDML XML Schema
---------------------------------

Steve M.: pointed to the fine detail of the description of the JDML job 
          description language that has been constructed for the EDG. There 
          is a lot of fine detail that allows much flexibility from this 
          schema, e.g. in the types for equations etc.
Ali: Could the documentation be made more complete for the JDML in order to 
     facilitate discussion?
Steve M.: will take a look.

It was agreed that this schema could provide a starting point in the 
structuring of the JSDL XML schema. It will be discussed in due course.


2. GGF9 Sessions:
=================

Agreed that the Session layout as described in the Agenda, above, is OK.


3. AOB:
=======

Possible face-to-face meeting if required, sometime between GGF9 and GGF10?


Actions:
========

Ali: to draft introductory slides for GGF9 Session 1.
Ali: to make additions suggested by Jim P. and Steve M. to the JSDL 
     spec doc contents.
Ali: to float on the list the question of whether the Normative JSDL 
     XML schema should appear as an appendix to the spec doc, or as a 
     separate deliverable as set out in the charter.
Ali: to float the scope of the JSDL re: types of jobs on the list for 
     discussion

Steve M.: to look at the documentation for JDML.
