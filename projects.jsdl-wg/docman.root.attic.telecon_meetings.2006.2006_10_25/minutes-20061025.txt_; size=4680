> 1. Agenda bashing
> 2. Logistics
>    - Confirm UTC teleconference time slot after summer time ends; also
>      call frequency

     Agreed to keep the same day (Wednesday) and *UTC time* (2pm) for
     the teleconferences.

     Call frequency was not discussed in detail. There may be a call
     next week if there is sufficient material to discuss. Otherwise
     due to the OGSA F2F & SC06 the next call may be in late November.


>     - Confirm session at next OGSA F2F (Nov 9,10). OGSA F2F tentative
>       agenda is on the wiki:
> https://forge.gridforum.org/sf/wiki/do/viewPage/projects.ogsa-wg/wiki/2006NovF2F

    Agreed that discussing XQuery and how it might fit in JSDL 2.0 (or
    even in JSDL 1.0/1.1) is a good idea.
    
    Michel already has a slot scheduled but probably more time is
    needed. Together with Ellen's material (info model/container etc)
    it should take half-a-day or more.

    The agenda for the F2F needs more detailing. It was agreed that
    this can be done offline.

    Michel is working on examples and a presentation and he will post
    them before the F2F for people to prepare.

> 3. Decide backwards compatibility approach (for JSDL 1.1)
>    - Discuss draft to be sent out by Michel and Donal.

    Michel gave an overview of the versioning document and the group
    discussed various possibilities to add more enforcement (e.g.,
    mandatory 'version' attribute on top-level jsdl element); or more
    fine-grained versioning (e.g,. 'version' attribute on individual
    elements). Agreed that keeping things simple as a start is a good
    idea. The overall approach looks good.

    Discussed specific versioning choices for JSDL 1.0/1.1 and
    2.0. JSDL 1.0 is out and does not have the 'schema' 'version'
    attribute. Also implementers have not reported any schema bugs
    that need fixing. Mostly requests have been for clarifications or
    additional explanation. And there is a plan for a JSDL 2.0 with
    substantial schema changes.

    Given the above it was agreed that a conservative approach for
    JSDL 1.1 is probably best in order to minimize implementation
    costs. This would mean no schema changes and only text changes for
    clarifications or to tighten definitions. (Even though there are
    some bugs that would require schema changes to fix they are not
    high-priority and there is no point to invalidate existing JSDL
    documents, especially when a major revision (2.0) is also being
    considered.)

    Agreed that the version attribute should be done for JSDL 2.0.

    Agreed that easy conversion between 1.0/1.1 and
    2.0 documents is a worthwhile target.

    The versioning document may be a nice document to put out
    eventually as a community practice or experience document.

> 4. Review any new extension drafts
>    - A new draft for Parallel Application (SPMDApplication) should
>      be ready.

     Andreas posted a new draft for 'parallel application' and
     highlighted some of the schema issues:
     - How to express that the SPMDNumberOfProcesses element should
       have no value if the actualtotalcpucount is true?
       - Initial definition uses nillable; it is not clear if it
         carries the correct semantics but may be safe for tooling
       - A union of integer and a special value is possible but may
         cause problems with some tooling
       - Using choices---again tooling support might be problematical
       - No clear decision. Andreas to research this further---get
         feedback from implementers or potential adopters.
     - SPMDVariation should be string or an enumeration?
       - Initial definition is half-way between these. Agreed that it
         is probably best to do this as an enumeration using the same
         approach as in JSDL 1.0: Use the 'other' escape value and
         extensibility element for the value.
       - Should the enumeration values be in a separate schema?
         Maybe. This is also something to consider for the 1.x to
         2.0 change. Many 1.0 enumerations are based on CIM and maybe
         WS-CIM work can be leveraged.

     Andreas will produce a new version, review on another call and
     (perhaps in parallel) send it to other stakeholders for comments.
