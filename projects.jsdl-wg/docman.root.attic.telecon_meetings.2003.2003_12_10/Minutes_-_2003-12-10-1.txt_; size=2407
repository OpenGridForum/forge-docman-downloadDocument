JSDL Job Attributes' Definition Properties:
-------------------------------------------

o What an attribute definition should include:

    o Should an attribute be 'Required' or 'Optional'?
      - Required in terms of the JSDL needs it, i.e. it must appear in 
        every JSDL document; OR
      - Required in terms of job description needs it, i.e. without this
        attribute the job cannot be scheduled.

    o Should the attribute be required to have a mapping to existing 
      DRM systems?
      - Should this mapping be complete, in other words, semantically 
        unambiguous?
      - Should there be mappings from existing DRM systems to JSDL which 
        are complete, for this attribute?

    o Should the attribute be 'Negotiable' or not?
      - can the user specify a preliminary value that is open to 
        negotiation by a job handling system/broker?
      Andreas H.: "What is the negotiation relationship for existing 
                   systems?"
      Ali: "Cannot let the JSDL satisfy only existing DRM systems, we 
           need a Grid language to satisfy Grid requirements, one of 
           which is negotiation."

    o Should the attribute have a lifetime?
      Karl: "Difficult to talk about lifetime in a general abstract way."

    o Does the attribute definition include relationships to other 
      attributes?
      - How should this be captured in the JSDL?
      - Does the attribute have requirements on other attributes

    o What are the attribute value types and ranges, enumeration 
      of values?
      Lee: "e.g. Counts should be numeric."

    o What is the multiplicity of the attribute?

    o Is the attribute's value mutable?
      Ali: "This is not in the scope of JSDL as a submission language."
