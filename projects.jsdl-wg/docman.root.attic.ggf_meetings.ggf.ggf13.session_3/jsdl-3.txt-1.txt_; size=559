- a tag to indicate what the client wants to be understood or not?
  - everthing should be understood vs

- In application
  - xsd::any##other that is cardinality 1
	vs doing an jsdl:applicationtype that is defined to be
	any##other
  - and list all applications that are defined separately

- need some tie-in to acs wrt application definitions

- limits lose all tags and the limit name becomes the tag name
- and these limits should be under application executable
- and the limits are not used for resource selection ; they are set in
  the environment.
