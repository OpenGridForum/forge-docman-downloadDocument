Session #1\
JSDL General Session\
October 14, 2009, 10:30 am - 12:00 pm\
URL: http://ogf.org/gf/event_schedule/index.php?id=1762\
# Participants: 13\

\
+ IPR presented & participant sheet distributed\
+ Agenda bashing\
  - JSDL session #2 as on printed schedule today at 14:45 @ MB150\
+ Work done since OGF 26\
  - Mainly Activity instance: schema specification & document writing\
  - More in session #2\
+ Discussion about new work to be executed by the JSDL-WG\
  - Already agreed upon:\
    * SPMD: survey & experience\
      # (Andre) SAGA users are interested in extensions. Are there any plans to work on it, e.g. include cores and \
          threads (and alignments)? - A (Andreas): Extensions are possible, but JSDL is currently not working on it. \
          Agreement: Resource requirements come from GLUE, JSDL not looking into it. Alignment later. \
          Suggestion: For a quick solution, SAGA should add its own resources.\
      # Action (Andreas): Prepare survey template\
    * Mini-spec to allow other resource descriptions \
    * Dependencies/workflow experience document\
  -  ---> All "new work" items are still valid, but not yet scheduled due to work done on activity instance schema\
  - Potential new work\
    * XQuery/GLUE --> mini spec to define resource requirements (<Resources> element) within JSDL through XQuery requests\
      # (Steve) Session on future of BES on Thursday 14:45.\
      # [NOTE: BES information delivered will more be service-related data; resource-related data via info services]\
      # Needed: GLUE schema. Then the XQuery for JSDL <Resources> can be done.\
      # [ACTION/Philipp] Check within projects who is willing to help with the XQuery.\
      # (Steve): There is a core GLUE spec. XML schema needed --> currently done by ARC.\
      # [ACTION/?]: Check when the XML GLUE schema is available.\
      # Q (Alexander): In case current <Resource> element is deprecated and substitued by XQuery, is this the only way \
        then to describe the request? - A (Andreas): No, in case you do not want to use XQuery, you can still use the \
        <Resource> element. XQuery is only one option. Plan to have something to be substituted with a OGF \
        specific schema for XQuery/GLUE (like done by the activity schema). (Alexander): Thinking of OVF/OCCI \
        results to be shipped as Resource requirements for JSDL.\
  - Further new work:\
    * Experience document on Parameter Sweep --> Check, when 6 months period for GFD.149 ends [DONE: Nov. 12, 2009]\
+ JSDL 2.0\
  - Pre-requisits:\
    * XQuery extension\
    * Dependencies. (Steve): In order to include dependencies you need to break backwards compatibility. \
      (Andreas): Not yet decided about backwards comp. Dependencies would be extensions: Deprecate DataStaging and extend \
       similar to <Resource> and XQuery (see above)\
    * Q (Philipp): Advertising work on JSDL 2.0 to get more momentum? - A: (Andreas) Do the pre-requisits first, go evolutionary \
       and then announce JSDL 2.0.\
    * Q (Wolfgang): Network resources go into job requirements? - A (Andreas): Yes, this will be possible.\
    * Q (Wolfgang): Licenses are to be also within JobRequirements? - A: Yes.\

Session #2\
JSDL Activity Instance Document Schema\
October 14, 2009, 14:45 pm - 16:15 pm\
URL: http://ogf.org/gf/event_schedule/index.php?id=1763\
# Participants: 9\
---\
\
+ Presenation of prototype implementation (see GridForge or session details)\
+ Alexander presenting the activity schema document in detail\
+ Discussion on schema. Life editing of the schema, result see GridForge. Selected discussion issues:\
  - Sealing an activity document:\
    * In-depth evaluation of adding signature to the document is necessary. Discussion at the next telecon. \
    * [ACTION/Donal]: Prepare proposal for next telecon.\
  - Timestamp also for where the entry is added to the activity history? - (Andrew): Potential problem with signing entry and \
    altering it afterwards. Solution: Leave the "receiving" timestamp to the container implementation.\
  - Q: If ActivityDefinition is ommitted, what does it mean? - A: There has to be one in the initial record, if it is ommitted,\
     the previous one is referred to.\
  - Q (Andrew): State --> Is there a notion of which model (e.g. BES Version X) to be followed. - A: Yes, through the \
    OGF-specific schema the namespace is carried.\
  - Dependency: Make clear what is done here. Atomicity, no workflow in there, etc.\
  - ManagerReference: It is an URI/EPR.\
  - ResourceUsage: UR may be used for monitoring. - (Donal): Intermediate UR is possible. --> Annotation written respectively.\
  - Category: [NOTE/Andrew]: People in BES which demand state transition from FINAL to READY to RUN again. \
    --> Independent of BES, the "final" category has a different semantic for the activity.\
  - "Initial" category: [Implementation NOTE]: Creation of activity creates the initial entry. \
+ Q (Andrew): Is it also possible to add a link to the core image to the exception? - A: Yes, through extension. \
   [NOTE]: Check whether there is the respective extension point. \
-----------------------------------------------------\
\
NOTE:\
The Activity concepts have been presented and discussed during the BES session. See respective notes for details.\
