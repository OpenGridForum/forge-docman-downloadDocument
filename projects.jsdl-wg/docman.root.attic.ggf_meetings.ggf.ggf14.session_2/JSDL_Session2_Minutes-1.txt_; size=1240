JSDL Session 2:
---------------

GridSAM presentation by Steve McGough
-------------------------------------

Slides and Demo

Peter: How do you map job states to DRMs and make sure they are 
       correct?

       Why not use DRMAA to connect to the DRMs?

Steve: We are not able to map states accurately if the DRM doesn't support 
       them.

       We are interested in using DRMAA.


NAREGI presentation by Hwang Soonwook
-------------------------------------

Slides and Demo

Multiplicity of POSIXApplication and Resources is more than 1. i.e. '*'

This is like having two JSDL docs lumped into one!

Is this like workflow in a JSDL doc?


HPCEuropa presentation by Ariel Oleksiak
----------------------------------------

Slides

Extensions: Software element inside the Resource.

            Queue element inside the Resource.

            DistrType element inside the Application.

            Objectives element inside the JobDescription 
              (Preference and Weighting factors).

Use JSDL to update the user portlet to specify what requirement elements are 
available for which DRM and what values the DRM instance picked by the user 
supports.

 - Requirement to specify whether the specified file is a directory.
