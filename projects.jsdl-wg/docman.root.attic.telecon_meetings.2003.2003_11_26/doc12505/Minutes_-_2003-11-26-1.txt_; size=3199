JSDL Job Attributes:
--------------------

o JobCategory:

 A S: What is "required"?
 A H: Whether a JSDL attribute set is "complete", i.e. does the attribute 
      match others in various DRM systems for mapping?
 A S: All attributes can be considered as required, i.e. can be used by a 
      system out there, but not all of them.
 A H: Must look at the consequences of the attributes in order to decide 
      what is required.
 A S: Required - for attributes that a DRM MUST understand. An instance of 
      a JSDL document MUST contain these attributes.
 Ali: Attributes that are absolutely required in the description.
      Default attribute values for the MUST attributes?
 Ali: Default attribute values break portability, i.e. the Default for a 
      particular attribute may be different for different DRMs and so the 
      job would be handled differently. This may result in different results 
      coming back from various DRM implementations. In addition, default 
      behaviour cannot be imposed on system implementors.
 A S: If an attribute is required to be in the JSDL it MUST have a value.
      Core set are all required?

Conclusions:

 A H: o For each attribute, must decide whether it is REQUIRED in a JSDL 
        document, and 

      o for each attribute, must decide whether each system implementation 
        will have a useful mapping.

 A S: o Definition of a core set of attributes, which are not all 
        necessarily REQUIRED. Common to all DRM systems?

      o REQUIRED attributes are a subset of the core set of attributes.

 Ali: o REQUIRED attributes must have a value. Not "default" and not "null".

 A S: o Attributes cannot have a default value. (All agree).

 A H: Questions to be asked:
        o Whether the JSDL doc can be considered complete? i.e. containing 
          all required attributes, and
        o whether the mapping can be considered complete for a particular 
          system? i.e. all required attributes can be mapped according to 
          the semantics of their definition.

      Consider: Whether there is a mapping for an attribute, and whether 
      there is a reverse mapping from a system language to JSDL.

 A H: It May be useful to use placeholders to define the value range of a 
      particular attribute, it is necessary to decide for each attribute 
      what the value range is.

 A H: Change the definition of ExecutionUserName to contain:

      "The 'ExecutionUserName' attribute MUST represent the 'username' of 
       the 'user' in the 'execution environment' where the 'job' will be 
       'executed'."

      instead of:

      "The 'ExecutionUserName' attribute MUST represent the 'username' of 
       the 'user' in the 'execution environment' where the 'job' is 
       currently 'running'."
