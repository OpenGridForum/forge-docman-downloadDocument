 Agreed to make first session intro/outreach and talk about work that
 is starting up in order to get more people involved. The second
 session to focus more on detailed work.

 - First Session:
   - Intro, outreach, parameter sweep extension, dependencies extensions

 - Second Session:
   - 1.0 Spec errata, parallel application extension review

 - Confirm session overlaps with HPCProfile and make sure relevant
   people can attend (Marvin, Chris)
   - Which topics should we leave for non-overlapping session,
     parallel job extension?

 - For parameter sweep and dependencies identify interested parties
   and invite them to join. Dependencies might be best done in a new
   WG but initial work can be done here with a view to identifying
   requirements on jsdl schema.

 - Try to setup Skype and Glance for people wanting to join remotely
