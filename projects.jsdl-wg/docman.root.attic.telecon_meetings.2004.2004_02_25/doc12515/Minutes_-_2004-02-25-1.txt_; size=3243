JSDL - What is?
---------------
 o Lee - use-cases of repeatability useful.

 o Steve - charter, defining language to get a job running on a resource.
           If it includes scheduling stuff then so be it.
           Scheduling bolt onto the core?

 o Lee - One attribute - calendar attribute - covers a lot of the ground.

 o Fred - If we start to include scheduling attributes, we may complicate 
          JSDL and have to include a scheduling model.

 o Ali - Scheduling ontology BoF at GGF10. Should consider participation.

--

 o Ali - request that JSDL definitions be sent out to the list by all so 
         that we can do requirements capture between us (core group first).

--

 o Lee - Security, broader scope of GGF work needs to be taken into 
         consideration.

 o Ali: Andreas to invite Frank S. to talk to us.
