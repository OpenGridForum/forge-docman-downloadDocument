Telecon times: In view of the low turn out of key contributors for the 
               07:00 GMT slot from the States, and the solo attendance of 
               Andreas Savva from Japan, this time slot will be suspended.

               Until further notice, then, the weekly JSDL telecon time 
               slot will toggle between 23:00 GMT and 14:00 GMT every four 
               Wednesdays, starting with a telecon at 23:00 on Wed. 14th 
               Jan. 2004.

               The up-to-date telecon schedule will be posted on the JSDL 
               GridForge front page at:

Job Attributes' Definition Properties:
--------------------------------------

o What an attribute definition should include:

    o Should an attribute be 'Required' or 'Optional'?
      1 - Required in terms of the JSDL needs it, i.e. it must appear in 
          every JSDL document; OR
      2 - Required in terms of the job description of a job instance needs 
          it, i.e. without this attribute the job cannot be scheduled.
          A - a user could specify the attribute as required for the job 
              instance (for the system to be able to accept the job.)
          B - a system could specify the attribute as required for the job 
              instance (if a system specific attribute were required, e.g. 
              a specific type of file transfer.)

    Note: 'Optional' is in terms of the value of the attribute being within 
          a certain range.

          ("Is Optional" - is open to the system ignoring its value?)

          If optional attributes are satisfied then you get better QoS, or 
          better job execution, e.g. if there's a checkpoint and migrate 
          option available from a system and a user has specified C&M as an 
          optional attribute then a system providing C&M is preferable to 
          one that doesn't.

  (Need to think about how DRM and other job handling systems should deal 
   with JSDL and individual attributes...)


    o Should the attribute be required to have a mapping to existing 
      DRM systems?
      - Should this mapping be complete, in other words, semantically 
        unambiguous (maps to only one functionality on each DRM and to the 
        same functionality across DRMS)? We need to make the translation 
        tables normative so that mappings to existing systems are well 
        understood.
      - Should there be mappings from existing DRM systems to JSDL which 
        are complete for this attribute? Again, refer to normative 
        translation tables.

    Notes: if an attribute does NOT have a mapping to an existing DRM 
           functionality, then a strong use-case is required for that 
           attribute to exist in the JSDL.

           We need to enable JSDL users to specify custom attributes, 
           perhaps DRM specific for specific system implementations to work 
           with (and they could be required!), through the JSDL's 
           extensibility mechanism.


<verbatim source="from minutes of 10th Dec 2003 telecon">

    o Should the attribute be 'Negotiable' or not?
      - can the user specify a preliminary value that is open to 
        negotiation by a job handling system/broker?
      Andreas H.: "What is the negotiation relationship for existing 
                   systems?"
      Ali: "Cannot let the JSDL satisfy only existing DRM systems, we 
            need a Grid language to satisfy Grid requirements, one of 
            which is negotiation."

    o Should the attribute have a lifetime?
      Karl: "Difficult to talk about lifetime in a general abstract way."

    o Does the attribute definition include relationships to other 
      attributes?
      - How should this be captured in the JSDL?
      - Does the attribute have requirements on other attributes

    o What are the attribute value types and ranges, enumeration 
      of values?
      Lee: "e.g. Counts should be numeric."

    o What is the multiplicity of the attribute?

    o Is the attribute's value mutable?
      Ali: "This is not in the scope of JSDL as a submission language."

</verbatim>


JSDL Job Schema Properties:
---------------------------

o Need logical operations for attributes: AND, OR ...?

o Need attribute composition, i.e. need to be able to put attributes 
  together, using above logical operators.

o Need to be able to do ranking of optional attributes by order of 
  preference.

o Need to enable JSDL users to specify custom attributes, perhaps DRM 
  specific for specific system implementations to work with (and they could 
  be required attributes).
