The 'Job Identity Attributes' (revision 4):

25th Nov. 2003

----------------------------------
o UserJobName

  A string specified by a 'user' to identify by 'name' the 'job' that 
  they are specifying for 'submission'.

  Only one instance of 'UserJobName' is allowed for each 'job description'.

  The 'UserJobName' cannot change for the 'lifetime' of the 'job'.

  The 'UserJobName' is not unique and a 'user' MAY specify the same 
  'UserJobName' for multiple instances of the same 'job', or indeed for
  different 'jobs'.

  A 'user' MAY use the 'UserJobName' attribute for their own search and 
  sort purposes.

----------------------------------
o SystemJobID

  A string specified by a 'job submission system' to uniquely identify the
  'job' that it is handling, for that system.

  Only one instance of 'SystemJobID' is allowed for each 'job description'.

  The 'SystemJobID' cannot change for the 'lifetime' of the 'job'.

  The 'SystemJobID' attribute MAY be unique for the 'job submission
  system'.

  The 'SystemJobID' attribute MAY be unique for all time.

  The 'job submission system' MAY use a 'timestamp' and 'job submission 
  system ID' for uniquely identifying 'job' instances.

----------------------------------
o UniqueJobID

  ?

----------------------------------
o SubmissionUserName

  A string specifying the 'username' of the 'user' in the 'submitting 
  environment', who is specifying the 'job' for 'submission'.

  Only one instance of 'SubmissionUserName' is allowed for each 
  'job description'.

  The 'SubmissionUserName' cannot change for the 'lifetime' of the 'job'.

  The 'SubmissionUserName' attribute MAY be specified by a 'user' or a 'job 
  submission system'.

  The 'SubmissionUserName' attribute MUST represent the 'username' of the 
  'user' in the 'submitting environment'.

  The resolution and use of the 'SubmissionUserName' attribute SHOULD be 
  'system' implementation dependent.

  The 'SubmissionUserName' attribute MAY be used for access control and 
  accounting mechanisms.

----------------------------------
o ExecutionUserName

  A string specifying the the 'username' of the 'user' in the 'execution 
  environment'.

  Multiple instances of 'ExecutionUserName' are allowed for each 
  'job description'. This should satisfy the need for the job to 'spawn' 
  'tasks' across multiple 'execution environments'.

  The 'ExecutionUserName' can change for the 'lifetime' of the 'job'. 
  This would satisfy 'migration' of the 'job' between different 
  'execution environments'.

  The 'ExecutionUserName' attribute MAY be specified by a 'user' or a 'job 
  submission system', or a 'scheduling system' following mapping from the 
  'SubmissionUserName'.

  The 'ExecutionUserName' attribute MUST represent the 'username' of the 
  'user' in the 'execution environment' where the 'job' is currently 
  'running'.

  The resolution and use of the 'ExecutionUserName' attribute at the 
  'execution environment' SHOULD be 'scheduling system' implementation 
  dependent.

  The 'ExecutionUserName' attribute MAY be used for access control and 
  accounting mechanisms.

----------------------------------
o UserGroupName

  A string specifying the 'group' or 'department' of the 'user' who is
  specifying the 'job' for 'submission'.

  Only one instance of 'UserGroupName' is allowed for each 
  'job description'.

  The 'UserGroupName' cannot change for the 'lifetime' of the 'job'.

  The 'UserGroupName' attribute MAY represent the name of a 'Virtual 
  Organisation' to which the 'user' belongs.

  The 'UserGroupName' attribute MAY be used for access control and 
  accounting mechanisms.

----------------------------------
o JobGroupName

  A string specifying the 'group' or 'department' to which the 'job' 
  belongs. This attribute can be used when a 'user' 'submits' a 'job' 
  on behalf of a 'group' to which the 'user' does not belong, i.e. in 
  such an instance the 'UserGroupName' is not the same as the 
  'JobGroupName'.

  Only one instance of 'JobGroupName' is allowed for each 
  'job description'.

  The 'JobGroupName' cannot change for the 'lifetime' of the 'job'.

  The 'JobGroupName' attribute MAY represent the name of a 'Virtual 
  Organisation' to which the 'job' belongs.

  The 'JobGroupName' attribute MAY be used for access control and 
  accounting mechanisms.

----------------------------------
o JobProjectName

  A string specifying the 'project' to which the 'job' belongs.

  Only one instance of 'JobProjectName' is allowed for each 
  'job description'.

  The 'JobProjectName' cannot change for the 'lifetime' of the 'job'.

  The 'JobProjectName' attribute MAY be used for access control and 
  accounting mechanisms.

----------------------------------
o JobCategory

  A string specifying the 'type' of 'job' that is specific to a particular 
  'scheduling system' or 'execution system'.

  Multiple instances of 'JobCategory' are allowed for each job 
  description. This should fulfill the need for the job to fall into 
  a number of categories. The user MUST be able to specify the priority 
  between the 'JobCategory' instances for the 'job' that they are 
  specifying for 'submission'.

  The 'JobCategory' instances cannot change for the 'lifetime' of the 
  'job'. 

  The 'JobCategory' attribute SHOULD be any string that is understood 
  by a 'scheduling system' or an 'execution system', that MAY enable 
  that system to associate a pre-defined set of 'policies' with the 'job'.

  The 'JobCategory' attribute SHOULD be any string that is understood 
  by a 'scheduling system' or an 'execution system', that MAY enable 
  that system to associate a pre-defined set of 'resource requirements' 
  with the 'job'.

  The 'policies' and 'resource requirements' that a 'system' may associate 
  with the 'job' according to the 'JobCategory' attribute, MAY be 
  'use domain' specific.

  The 'policies' and 'resource requirements' that a system may associate 
  with the 'job' according to the 'JobCategory' attribute, MAY be 
  'scheduling system' or 'execution system' specific.

  The 'JobCategory' attribute MAY be used for access control and 
  accounting mechanisms.
