  The 'UserJobName' is not unique and a 'user' MAY specify the same 
  'UserJobName' for multiple instances of the same 'job', or indeed for
  different 'jobs'.

  A 'user' MAY use the 'UserJobName' attribute for their own search and 
  sort purposes.

----------------------------------

  The 'SubmissionUserName' attribute MUST represent the username of the 
  'user' in the 'submitting environment'.

  The 'JobProjectName' attribute MAY be used for access control and 
  accounting mechanisms.

----------------------------------
o JobCategory

  A string specifying the 'type' of 'job' as specific to a particular 
  'scheduling system' or 'execution system'.

  The 'JobCategory' attribute SHOULD be any string that is understood 
  by a 'scheduling system' or an 'execution system', that MAY enable 
  that system to associate a pre-defined set of 'policies' with the 'job'.

  The 'JobCategory' attribute SHOULD be any string that is understood 
  by a 'scheduling system' or an 'execution system', that MAY enable 
  that system to associate a pre-defined set of 'resource requirements' 
  with the 'job'.

  The 'policies' and 'resource requirements' that a system may associate 
  with the 'job' according to the 'JobCategory' attribute, MAY be 
  'use domain' specific.

  The 'policies' and 'resource requirements' that a system may associate 
  with the 'job' according to the 'JobCategory' attribute, MAY be
