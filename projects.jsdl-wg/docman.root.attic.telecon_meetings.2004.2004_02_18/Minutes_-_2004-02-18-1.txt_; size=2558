Discussion:
===========

Administrative:
---------------

o Updates of attribute sets to Andreas (or GridForge) by end of 
  Friday 20th PST.


Data Attributes:
----------------

o Andreas and Steve to review data attributes by next week. Take into 
  account Donal and Michal's comments on the list and the minutes from 
  the 11/02/04 meeting. Then put in the doc and send out to the list.


Security Attributes:
--------------------

Ali: Do we need all this security stuff? And if so how much of it do we 
     need in the JSDL?

Lee: WS-Security - web service security workflow through the Grid.
     Submission vs. Execution, the former being addressed WS-Security.

Ali: Do security and scheduling stuff belong in JSDL?

Steve: Onion shell analogy scheduling-layer/security-layer/resource-layer 
       requirements.
Ali: Same as Job categories!

Fred: Danger of running away with the details of scheduling etc. in the 
      JSDL and coming up with a model rather than a language.

Lee: on the scheduling attributes: trigger and repeatability, meet the 
     needs of the job to run at a particular time; are powerful.

Donal: What is the minimum scheduling attribute set that we need?

Lee: leaving this stuff out would put a dependency on behalf of the JSDL, 
     i.e. need a workflow now! Who would provide the scheduling attributes 
     that we throw out?

---

Ali: Clean up the attributes, send to Andreas by end of 
     Friday 20th Feb. PST.


GGF10:
------

o Lee - possibly remote conference.

o Ali to set up remote conference call for GGF10 meetings.

o Donal, possibly be there.

o Sessions:
  - Fred: to lead a discussion on scheduling and resource attributes
          and JSDL scope (re: scheduling model in or out of JSDL).
  - Andreas: to lead a discussion on data attributes.
  - Ali : JobID and security attributes.


AOB:
----
o Lee: Want to highlight: "What is JSDL?" in the document.
