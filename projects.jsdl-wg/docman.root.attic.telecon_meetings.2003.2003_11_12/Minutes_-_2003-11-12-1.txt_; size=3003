Discussion:
===========

Administrative:
---------------

o Ali - Migration to GridForge making good progress.

o Andreas S. - Put spec. under "Working Drafts" in GridForge
               Use file publisher on GridForge?

o Ali - Should keep it simple and not complicate matters with tools that 
        we don't understand, if we don't need to use them.

o Ali - Spec. now lies with Andreas S.

o Ali - Will add meeting info to front page of the GridForge site.


JSDL Job ID Attributes:
-----------------------

o UserJobName

  Darren - External to JSDL, will be used for tie in for applications.
  Andreas S. - Suggest JobAnnotation instead.
  Fred - Agree with JobAnnotation.
  Darren - "properties" ?
  Ali - Properties is external set? Use extension mechanism for them?
  Andreas H. - What is the translation/mapping of attribute?
  Ali - Use for "search and sort"; is not JSDL bound. i.e. no semantics.
  Andreas S. - JobAnnotation is a wider scope than a JobName.
  Ali - Propose to postpone JobAnnotation attribute for later consideration.


o SystemJobID

  Andreas S. - Should provide a unique system specific job ID.
  Ali - should have another attribute, "UniqueSystemJobID"?
  Andreas H. - No.
  Andreas S. - Would like to be able to identify uniqueness of 
               system job ID, perhaps an attribute of SystemJobID.
  Ali - Add an optional UniqueSystemJobID to the list of attributes.


o SubmissionUserName

  Andreas S. - Does it need to be bound to other attributes to make an 
               assumption about it?
  Ali - Do we need this attribute to be associated to other attributes?
        A JSDL defines a job and we shouldn't be trying to make every 
        attribute uniquely identifiable for each job.


o ExecutionUserName

  Andreas H. - Optional attribute. May need multiple ExecutionUserName(s)
  Andreas H. - multiple ExecutionUserName(s), then must specify domain(s) 
               to map them to for their use.
  Andreas S. - Pre-defined configuration? Intelligent broker can map to the 
               system using configuration.
  Ali - Propose only one user name, that is, the local user name that is 
        mapped by the implementation of the system to where it is needed.
  Andreas S. - ExecutionUserName is useful and we should keep it in, though 
               the definition needs work.
  Andreas H. - The system should be able to assign an ExecutionUserName to 
               a running job. Possible definition of ExecutionUserName 
               tied to a running job?
  Ali - Action to think about what this attribute is trying to achieve.
