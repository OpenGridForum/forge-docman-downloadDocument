 Talk on the HPC Basic Profile:
 	Chris S. gave an overview.
 	- Data is out of the HPC Basic Profile.
 	- The HPC JSDL extension will be submitted through the JSDL
 	  group for public comment.
 	- Try and move HPC JSDL extension into the first session.
 
 Overview of emerging extensions
 	Michel presenting on Job Groups
 	- Job Groups have Hierarchal groups.
 	- Some types of dependencies have been mentioned.
 	- Questions about why do this with Xquery on the plate of
 	  something to do.
 	- Should we wait until 2.0 instead of basing from 1.1?
 	- Question, can two jobs start at the same time?
 	Parameter Sweep Extension
 	- We need to discuss what other options and why we have
 	  decided to do parameter sweeps. What is the benefit to doing
 	  parameter sweeps?
 	- This really is a part of workflow type definitions.
 	- This is good stuff, but may be out of scope for JSDL. It
 	  could go into a workflow group instead.
 
 HPC Basic Profile revisited.
 	- Question to change in WorkingDirectory definition. We
 	  changed the fault state if the working directory does not
 	  exist.
 	- WorkingDirectory must be absolute.
 	- Walltime limit should be moved into the BES specification
 	  under the BES information segment.
 	-File name delimiter. Should we continue to just use a
 	xsd:string or should be move to a xsd:uri. FileURIs must be
 	supported then we need to use it.
