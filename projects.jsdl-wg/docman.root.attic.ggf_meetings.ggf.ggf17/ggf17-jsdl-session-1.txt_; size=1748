GGF17 JSDL-WG Session 1
=======================

* Agenda bashing

  Agreed to a short time-bounded (20 minutes) discussion on
  information/data models for resource requirements description.

* Information/data model for resource requirements

  Jay Unger introduced the work being done by the OGSA Information
  Model design team. One topic under discussion in that team is a way
  of defining new resource characteristics or capabilities that does
  not rely on creating a new XML schema for them.  For example, while
  JSDL 1.0 provides an xsd:any extension point that allows addition of
  new elements the new proposal may define instead an element that can
  be used to add arbitrary new <names,value> tuples. In XML, the
  difference between:
              <mynewelement>v1</mynewelement>
                vs
              <extension name="mynewelement" value="v1"> 

  A number of people expressed interest. This work will continue
  within the OGSA-WG Information Model team. 

* Use cases and requirements for Parallel Jobs

  There were presentations by NAREGI and GridSAM. The group also
  reviewed some of the BSC slides.
  - NAREGI: MPI extension to POSIXApplication and co-allocation
  - GridSAM: MPI extension to POSIXApplication
  - BSC: Multi-level parallelism definition---partly to define process
    count and thread count
  - Platform: parallelism is defined in resource requirements. No
    requirements to extend JSDL 1.0 for this feature right now.

  Finally the group identified a preliminary set of features that seem
  to be common to the various approaches (see agenda slides). 

  Steve McGough took an action to come up with a pseudo-schema for
  review at the next session.
