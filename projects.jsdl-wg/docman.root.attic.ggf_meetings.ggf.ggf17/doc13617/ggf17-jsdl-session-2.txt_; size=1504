GGF17 JSDL-WG Session 2
=======================

* Typicla Parallel Job requirements

  Stephen Pickles presented a perspective on what users defining
  parallel jobs typical require. Two types of jobs
  - (Majority) Require a specific number of processes, typically power
    of 2
  - (Minority) Can adapt to the number of processes actually
    'allocated' to it at runtime

  ... 

  Keep it simple. Trying to do something with many features may defeat
  the purpose since many users might not be able to use it. Several
  (negative) examples of this in existing projects.

* Review of pseudo schema 

  Discussion based on the pseudo schema Steve McGough produced after
  the previous section.

  - Agreed to define this as an extension to POSIXApplication.
  - Discussed requirement for multiple executables. It could be
    defined as a list of POSIXApplications but agreed it may be too
    complex for too little benefit. (Even when multiple executables
    are needed they are typically 2). Agreed to name extension
    SPMDApplication to highlight the single executable nature.
  - Discussed the need or lack of for 'helper commands' or
    'arguments'. Agreed that these should be inferable from the type
    of parallel application and that it is not possible to
    standardize. Instead we should identify a common set of arguments:
    NumberOfProcesses and ProcessesPerHost seem to be the two needed.
  - Identified a set of issues (recorded in the ppt)
