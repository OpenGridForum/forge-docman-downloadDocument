Steve on Operators
------------------

o Discussion at last telecon on operators.

o Donal concerned about the complexity of introducing operators like XOR!

o Steve - motivation for XOR.

o Donal preference for AND, OR, and NOT, no numerical operations, and 
   * notMoreThan - useful for memory constraints
   * notLessThan - useful for processor speed constraints
   * exactlyEqualTo - useful for host names

  Leave out for now:
   * approximatelyEqualTo - someone's bound to want this, even though its
     exact interpretation would be implementation-defined.

o Steve to come up with schema for these operations and revise the JSDL.xsd

  AND, OR, NOT, ==, <=, >=


o Andreas - are all these operations required to be understood by JSDL 
            compliant systems?

o Steve - Yes, these are all required.

o Steve - to come up with list of reserved key words that JSDL wishes to 
  use in the future.



Spec
----
o Chase up Darren on current status, location of spec.


GGF12 discussion
----------------
o To discuss required vs. optional operations
o To discuss where numerical operations fit in (how they fit in?)
o To discuss the open issues in the spec: list them prior to discussion
o To discuss topology, examples from Chris... will be at GGF12
