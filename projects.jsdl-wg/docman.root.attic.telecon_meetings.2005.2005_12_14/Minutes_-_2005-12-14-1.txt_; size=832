Session and future plans
=====================
Extensions to JSDL should be the focus first and then we can look and see where the spec is missing.
We need to get the groups that are doing extensions to submit there extensions into JSDL group so we have a general place for this.
We need to look at the tracker and come up with a plan on how to move forward.
Advertise the new wiki as a place to move forward.
