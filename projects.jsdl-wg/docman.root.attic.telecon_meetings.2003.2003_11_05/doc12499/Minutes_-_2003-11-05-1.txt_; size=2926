Discussion:
===========

Admin:
------

o Ali to hand over the JSDL spec doc skeleton to Andreas S., he takes over 
  as the main editor. He "has the pen".

o GridForge: Fred sent the proposed structure of the JSDL GridForge site to 
  the list. Discussion was helpful and agreeable. He will put the basic 
  structure up by the next call on 12/11/2003.

o Ali to send Fred the archive material from the JSDL web site at Edinburgh 
  for the new GridForge site by 14/11/2003.

o Ali to put the telecon info on the JSDL GridForge front page.


JSDL Job ID Attributes:
-----------------------

o Karl feels that the 'job identity attributes' that Ali sent to the list
  are too general and that there is too much semantics packed into each 
  attribute.

o Ali agrees that when he wrote this he was trying to introduce too much 
  flexibility into the use of each attribute and that this is perhaps the 
  wrong way to do it.

o SystemJobID was discussed. Karl pointed out that this attribute is several 
  attributes rolled into one.

  Andreas H. - SystemJobID has a special role, it is not an attribute that 
  a user can specify.

o Karl -- missing from this list, SystemJobAnnotation, also RelatedJobID - 
  one-to-many mapping so can be a list.

o Karl - rule of thumb, 'OR' in the definition means different meanings. 
  Attributes should be more specifically defined.

o Andreas H. - translating between the UserName in the different 
  environments, 'submitting environment', 'executing environment', 
  'job management environment' requires mapping.

o Ali - More specific specification of the UserName??

o Karl - 'requestor', 'authenticating credentials', 'username of the account'
  of the job are different attributes. Credentials delivered as part of the 
  job.

  Difference between job control and job specification. Job history.

  In terms of views, how we view a job? should group together the set of 
  attributes. (?)

o Default attributes and optional attributes, local vs. remote UserNames.
  Use a view of the job that allows submission and provide the information 
  to do the mapping and translation.

o Ali - Provide the information for the system to do its job.

o Karl - Group, "access control protection group", "etc.", there are other 
  types of Groups.


AOB:
----

o Andreas - translation is very important, what kind of views are needed is
  dependent on what kinds of mappings you want to have. Translation is 
  important.

o Andreas Savva. - can use translation tables as examples of attribute 
  definitions.
