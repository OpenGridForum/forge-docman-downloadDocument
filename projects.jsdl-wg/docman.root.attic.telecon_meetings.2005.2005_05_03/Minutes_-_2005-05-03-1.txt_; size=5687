Possible JSDL meeting to go with the OGSA F2F meeting in London.


Agenda & Minutes
----------------

 5) Section 3 (spec doc) general revision and polishing up

    - To be done...

    - Action: Andreas

    - Owners for: Glossary
                : Extending JSDL

    --> On Going
    --> On Going
    --> On Going


 6) Update explanation for jsdl:other usage

    - jsdl:other is the value for e.g. other arch and OS name etc.

    - Have defined this and behaviours - have to be able to process it and 
      must reject the document if can't be processed.

    - To add extra information that is allowed to be ignored if can't be 
      processed, but, jsdl:any can't be ignored.

    - Section 4.2 - placeholder (maybe better in the Extending JSDL section).

    --> Action: Steve (with Michel) - as number 17

    --> On Going (03-May-2005)
    --> On Going (Almost Done)


 8) JSDL compliance levels
    How much of jsdl a system must support, not just process.
    Probably a topic for later.

    - Placeholder, will come up later!

    [DONE] - Action: Michel

    --> Action: ALL to review Michel's e-mail to list: JSDL compliance levels
    http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/jsdl-wg/2005/04/msg00111.html

    --> Action: Ali to edit Michel's proposed entry (03-May-2005)

    --> On Going


 9) The statement "If not supported then the consuming system MUST reject
    the document." needs a bit more explanation or re-write.

    - Related to number 8 above.

    - Refer to notational convention

    [DONE] - Action: Michel

    --> Action: ALL to review Michel's e-mail to list: JSDL compliance levels
    http://www-unix.gridforum.org/mail_archive/jsdl-wg/2005/04/msg00111.html

    --> Action: Ali to edit Michel's proposed entry (03-May-2005)

    --> On Going


11) Filesystem name and type and filesystem reference in DataStaging

    - This needs to be specified? Needs more explanation?

    - Action: Andreas

    - FileSystemID changed to FileSystemName
    - Define well known filesystem names: HOME and TMP

    --> On Going
    --> On Going
    --> On Going


*** 12) Mountpoint environment variable. Is the current approach ok, or
    should we provide a separate mechanism, e.g, a tag that if present
    provides the name of the environment variable in which the
    MountPoint value must be present.

    - If a Mountpoint environment variable is not specified, then the name 
      of the filesystem is used for the value of the env var.

    - Action: ALL to review spec section 5.5.12 and get back to the list

    - Issue to be discussed on the list.

    --> On Going
    --> On Going
    --> On Going

    *** Can leave out of v1.0


14) DRMAA use case for defining filenames. We have to at least be able
    to show an example of how to define and stage out an <Output> file.

    - Action: Andreas

    [DONE]- Action: Donal to suggest alternative

    - Action: ALL to review Donal's suggestion on the mailing list.

    - Action: Donal to chase this on the list...

    --> On Going
    --> On Going


16) Process Topology needs review. In particular are the examples ok or
    not, are the definition correct and so on. Delete the yellow
    comments once that is done. Not sure if we should define the precise
    allocation behaviour or allow for that to be defined instead.

    - Action: ALL to review this section (Section 6 in 0.9.5-01).
        - ProcessCount to be put back into POSIX Application.
        - ProcessCountLimit in the POSIX Application.

    [DONE] --> Action: Chris to bring issues to list if any

    - Action: ALL to review discussion on this on the list

    - Action: Karl to send summary of discussion to the list

    - Action: Andreas to put final recommendation from Karl's summary in the spec.

    --> On Going
    --> On Going
    --> On Going


17) Section "Extending JSDL" needs an owner. I expect this section to be
    about 1 page long so should not be too much trouble.

    - Action: Steve (with Michel as wingman)

    --> On Going
    --> On Going (03-May-2005)
    --> On Going (Almost Done)
