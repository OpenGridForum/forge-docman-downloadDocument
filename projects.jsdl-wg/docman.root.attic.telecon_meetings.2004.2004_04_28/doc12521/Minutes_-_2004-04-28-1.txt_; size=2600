----------------------------------------------
Structure of the JSDL XML Document
---------------------------------------------
Instance or Template? (Andreas - Put the definition of our XML Template in the Introduction to the Doc.) JSDL XML Document will be submitted to a system that will create an instance of a job. 
JSDL defines what the job is not how it is instantiated.

What is the minimum set of attributes to submit a job?  Just the executable fragment should be required.

We need to have the concept of XML fragments that can be optional, but if include MUST have specific attributes defined.

----------------------------------------------
Section Reports (Andreas to get the information from the teams)
----------------------------------------------
* Job ID - (Darren will look and review this stuff.)
* Resource (Fred and An)
Scheduling One Attribute (
Security (Put in a placeholder) - There should be a security fragment that should be created.
* Data (Steve, An and Andreas)
* Introduction (Andreas, Ali)

Document research of the XML schema at the end of the document.

Translation tables will be another document. (Darren will have a draft of this in a couple of weeks)
