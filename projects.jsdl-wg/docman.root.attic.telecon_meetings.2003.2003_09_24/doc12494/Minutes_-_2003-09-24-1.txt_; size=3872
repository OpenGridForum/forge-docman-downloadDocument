o Discussion of the Job Terms Proposal

  - how do we proceed with this proposal?

    * suggest discussion on list followed up at 
      the second session of JSDL-WG at GGF9.

    * suggest adopting the document as informational 
      document - a proposal for the JSDL structure.

    * require fine tuning of the contents.


Discussion:
===========

Ali: Happy to take the Platform/Globus "Job Terms Proposal" document into 
     the JSDL as an informational document, which proposes a JSDL structure 
     based on the new WS-Agreement framework proposal (under development) 
     and leverages its terms language structure.

Steve: Happy to take this document into the JSDL. Would like to add more 
       to the set proposed therein.

Chris: Notes encouraging overlap with EDG Job Description Language (JDL), 
       documents for which were posted on the list by Fabrizio Pacini.

Karl: Will give talk to JSDL-WG at GGF9 with Alain. Would like an hour to 
      present and discuss WS-Agreement framework and the Job Terms Proposal.

Ali: Will schedule one hour for WS-Agreement framework and the Job Terms 
     Proposal discussion at the second JSDL-WG session at GGF9.

Darren: Notes that there are a lot of other languages out there. Should use 
        these.

Ali: Expresses minor worries over some of the details of the attributes in 
     the Job Terms Proposal, say for example expression of filepaths etc. 
     Will post concerns to the list.

Steve: XNODES (similar to Unix INODES), for file access, file path 
       definition.



Ali: Points out that the Job Terms depend on WS-Agreement development.

Karl: Agrees. It's early days, both can develop over next 2 to 3 GGFs.



Steve: Expresses worry about OGSA/OGSI. Can a "terms language" based JSDL 
       satisfy non-Grid Services architectures? Lots of existing systems.

Ali: The Job Terms docs will be XML docs. So it should be easy to parse and 
     pick and choose what you need from them. The important issue is to have 
     access to the schema that define the terms language and the Job Terms. 
     Without the WS-Agreement and terms language, the terms language would 
     essentially have to be taken care of within the JSDL anyway, i.e. 
     defining attributes to say whether a description element is required or 
     merely preferred, and defining limits, and ranges, and enumerations etc.

Karl: Agree that JSDL terms language is neutral. Security mechanism is 
      architecture agnostic. How the security of the job is configured is 
      important.



Darren: Is there any worry from vendors that the JSDL will break the market.

Chris: No. Differentiate products on distinctive product values and features.



Ali: What is the view of Platform on DRMAA

Chris: Platform are not looking at DRMAA since there are language 
       dependencies to the interface. They will not be supporting DRMAA 
       as they subscribe to the Grid Services architecture that is more 
       flexible in terms of providing an interface.



Ali: Shall we propose the Job Terms Proposal as a JSDL informational 
     document within the JSDL-WG, as a base for building on?

ALL: "Yeay".

Ali: Will send out mail to the list re: the Job Terms Proposal and ask for 
     comments.



Ming Xu will talk on the Program Execution Environment Architecture from 
OGSA, at the second session of JSDL-WG at GGF9.

Hiro will send Ali the OGSA draft that has been submitted, for Ali to link
off the JSDL-WG page and post notice to the list.
