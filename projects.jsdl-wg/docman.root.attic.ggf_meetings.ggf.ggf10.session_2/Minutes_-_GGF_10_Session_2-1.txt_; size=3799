Presentation by Ali on JSDL Job ID attributes: See:

This slide set has been annotated from the meeting's discussions.


Job ID Attributes' Presentation and Discussion
==============================================

o JobName
  - Lifetime of a Job is from start to finish. If a job fails then it must 
    be re-submitted.
  - Remove the requirement that an attribute cannot be changed because an 
    attribute cannot change when the job is submitted because it is a 
    single action.

o JobID
  - This should be an opaque string.
  - Discussion is whether this is valid or not. Should the JobID be 
    handed back or passed in?
  - Could there be more than one JobID corresponding to a job. One that 
    the user specifies and/or one that the scheduling system supplies.
  - The JobID could be used by a "job submission system" (for internal 
    use) to identify a job.
  - The JobID could be external to the JSDL document, since the document 
    needs to be referenced somehow, anyway.

o UniqueJobID
  - Is not needed.
  - Jobs are unique within a namespace, so let the implementors worry 
    about it.

o SubmittingUserName
  - Remove the requirement that an attribute cannot be changed because an 
    attribute cannot change when the job is submitted because it is a 
    single action.
  - Use for e.g. authentication and accounting.
  - Need to be mappable to a "real" username.

o ExecutionUserName
  - Remove the requirement that an attribute cannot be changed because an 
    attribute cannot change when the job is submitted because it is a 
    single action.
  - Use for e.g. authentication and accounting.
  - Need to be mappable to a "real" username.
  - References security object that allows for authentication on a system. 
    Should(?) be an XML fragment.
  - Talk to the security guys.
  - This is an executing identity not a username.
  - Bill: specific use-cases useful.

o UserGroupName
  - Execution Group Name
  - Submission Group Name - Could be used from complex Policy stuff.
  - Should this be divided into "submission" and "execution"?
  - Use-case for submission group name? The submission username does not 
    necessarily provide this. i.e. do we need submission group name?
  - Darren: No submission group name is required. (open issue).
  - Should(?) be an XML fragment?



Presentation by Steve on JSDL Data attributes: See:

https://forge.gridforum.org/projects/jsdl-wg/document/JSDL-WG_GGF10_Session_2_-_JSDL_Data_Attributes_NOTES/en/2

This slide set has been annotated from the meeting's discussions.


Data Attributes' Presentation and Discussion
============================================

 Q: Are we talking about program files or data file
 Steve: we haven't specified.

 C: Fred: Provisioning is more than just copying files, it's also 
    installation and configuration.

 C: Recursive copying of files? Copy a directory means its contents also?

 C: FileSystemName -> DomainName? Should be relative to "path".

 C: Shared file space for files and specific directory for others.

 Q: Physical or logical filename?

 C: Overwrite Attribute: file permissions/privileges for files when 
    overwriting? Persist permissions of existing or staged file?

 Q: We need to address file priority for transfers.

 C: Require at least a "source" or a "target" on the File attribute.

 C: How does one express that one needs a file to be present but 
    doesn't know if the file is there or not?

Need to specify that a file exists or does not exist on a resource?
