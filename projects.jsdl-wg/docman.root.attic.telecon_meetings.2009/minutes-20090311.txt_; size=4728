* Parameter Sweep
  
** Specify which xpath functions to use?
  - No. And do not need to specify how they will be evaluated. It is
    specified in the xpath specification

    ACTION: Geoff to modify one of the substring substitution examples
            so that the strings are not be the same length after
            substitution

** XPath 1.0 XPath 2.0 and wording 

  Agreed to change to wording to say initial only XPath and then in
  the final sentence of the paragraph to say that XPath 2.0 is
  'SHOULD' and Xpath 1.0 is MAY as long is subset of 2.0

  ACTION: Andreas will send Geoff sample replacement text.
  
  Sample text:

>  The type of the DocumentNode's Match element is an XPath [XPATH]
>  expression. The evaluation of the XPath expression MUST yield a
>  [sequence] containing exactly one [item]. The [item] can be a
>  [node] or an [atomic value] as per the XPath specification.  The
>  XPath expression MAY select parts of the contents of an XML element
>  or attribute using any of the standard XPath functions, for example
>  “fn:substring()”. XPath 2.0 expressions and functions SHOULD be
>  used. XPath 1.0 MAY be used but in this case the subset common with
>  XPath 2.0 MUST be used.


* Suggestion on the list to change text to "The [item] can be exactly
  one [attribute] node, [text] node or [atomic value]. "

  - Agreed to not restrict type of nodes. It seems too restrictive at
    the moment.
  - Agreed that it replacement should be the 'same type'. This text is
    already in the text but the wording seemed not to be precise
    enough.

   ACTION: Donal will review data type text and suggest a revision by
           the end of the week

** Schema URI

   - Schema URIs are incorrect since at least two of them were updated
     in 2008.

   - Agreed to uniformly change all three to 2009/03

   ACTION: Geoff to modify schema URIs

** OGF copyright 

   ACTION: Geoff to add OGF Copyright to the schemas.

   - Donal suggested putting in as annotation rather than comment.
