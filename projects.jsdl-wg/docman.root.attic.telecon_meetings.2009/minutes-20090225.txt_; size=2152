* Parameter sweep

  - Agreed to 
    - Exceptions being type double
    - Accuracy using decimal
    - Step accuracy suggestion
      - Donal will send Geoff text
    - Delete "determine an acceptable ..."
    - "Respond appropriately" 

  - Update the text and have a version ready before OGF25 for review
    during the session

* Activity schema

> - R008b: Does the access control info change during the lifetime of an
> activity?

It can change during the lifetime of the activity. But access control
does not sound as something to have in the activity document itself

> - R022: Which exceptions are to be captured. Those between the last
> historical record has been written and the current one? All until
> now?

  Capturing state changes as new records. If more granularity is
  needed it is up to implementation

> - Currently I just import the bes-factory:ActivityStatusType. Is this
> sufficient?
> - Currently the schema imports bes-factory and ws-adressing. Dow we want
> this dependencies?

It is ok to import all schemas that are needed.

> - The current draft contains a number of xsd:any elements. The question
> is whether we want to become more concrete and e.g. force the activity
> description to be JSDL and the resource usage to be RUS? [Note: During
> today's discussion people expressed their preference for a more concrete
> schema where OGF standards are used for the different elements.]
> 

- In general:
  - Use OGF specs
  - Make schema more concrete while allowing extensibility
    - xsd:other is one way to allow extensibility. There are a couple
      (at least) more including using substitution groups and the way
      cim schema is defined (xsi:type?)
    - Andreas will send Philipp examples as input before making a
      decision

- Records are marked as "original / interim / ..."  but later change
  also change the marking on previous ones which is not good.
