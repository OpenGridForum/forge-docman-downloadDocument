* JSDL v1.1 issues
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Andreas discussed the state of JSDL 1.1, and in particular the
  desire not to make schema changes unless there are very good
  reasons. So far issues are mainly (but not completely) spec
  (definition) errata.

  Hiro: Re GFSG and Editor Errata Process, or rather, lack of. Is this
  just an errata release?
  
  Andreas: We would use an OGF Editor Errata Process if there was
  one. For now, we are considering some additions e.g. software
  resource or library, as well as errata, but, keeping schema and
  namespace unchanged - to help implementors keep their JSDL 1.0 based
  implementations the same. The additions would be done in a separate
  namespace and use the extnsibility points in the main schema.

  Andreas showed the issues that may require feature additions:
  - artf5562: Dave Snelling suggested checking the BES spec to see if
    the "software resource" or "library" has been included, if not,
    then make this a low priority. (Andreas will check)

 - artf5641: Optionality on elements is a thorny problem and would be
   better to think about very carefully. Probably a good topic to
   leave for v2.0.

 - artf5497: An element is specified in the spec but missing in the
   schema. Noone has complained about this (and so changing the schema
   to fix it is probably not necessary).  One idea is to just delete
   it from the spec, if this is just an errata release.

 - Dave Snelling: Proposed to publish just an Errata release (no
   additions), once an editor process is in place for this.

 Andreas and Steve agreed as long as a process for Errata is put into
 place soon. Otherwise the group may move forward to publish a new
 document. Need to discuss on the list and calls.

* JSDL Parameter Sweep Extension (Ali and Michel)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Ali gave an overview of the possible usage scenarios and motivation
  for feature set. Michel described detailed features that should be
  supported. (See slides.)

  There was a lot of interest and a number of topics came up.
  - Iteration of parameter values dependent on resource availability,
    or application need. Need conditional iteration, parameter sweeps.
  - Also consider parameter sweeps dependent on application result
    outcome - application dependent. Consider Nimrod!
 
  Agreed to start work on this extension. A number of different
  requirements were expressed and a next step is to clarify the scope.
  Continue the discussion on the list and teleconfs and invite
  interested parties to join the work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* JSDL 2.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Andreas gave an overview of issues with JSDL 1.0 and motivation for
 the next major version (see slides).  Some work is already happening
 (XQuery requirements) but there are many gaps, e.g.,
 dependencies/workflow, information modeling etc, that have to be
 filled in before a next major version becomes possible.

 The Chairs think that an incremental approach---rolling out new
 features are extensions to 1.0 and using established implementations
 to test them incrementally and inform the design---is necessary. Once
 everything is in place then publication of a 2.0 is possible.

 Fabio (over the phone) gave a quick overview of Requirements
 slides. Due to lack of time the presentation will be re-scheduled on
 a JSDL teleconference.

 This work will gradually start taking center stage as other work is
 completed.
