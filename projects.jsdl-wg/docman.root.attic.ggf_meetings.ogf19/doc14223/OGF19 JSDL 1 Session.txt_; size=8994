-- JSDL-WG Session 1 --

OGF19, Chapel Hill, NC, USA
Friday 2nd Feb 2007

Chairs: Andreas Savva, Stephen McGough
Scribe: Ali Anjomshoaa (& Andreas Savva)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Andreas talked about the status of group and its recent activities;
  showed timeline (see slides) and expected completion of ongoing
  work.

  There are three drafts in progress (HPC Parallel Application,
  Parallel (SPMD) Application, JSDL 1.1) and proposals for new work:
  Parameter Sweep. Also work on the next major version (JSDL 2.0) is
  beginning (exploratory work has began for some parts).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Review of "HPC Profile Application Extension v1.0 draft 6"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  HPC Profile was initially developed within the OGSA HPC Profile WG
  and handed over to JSDL-WG for finalization and publication. 

  Chris gave an overview of the status of the draft.  This has been
  stable since last October after review on a JSDL call. Draft 6 on
  GridForge has some minor changes:
  - The namespace changed to better fit in with the JSDL namespaces
  - Made the <Executable> element optional (0 to 1) rather than
    required. This is based on feedback from the EMS Scenarios work.
  - Other minor edits, <WorkingDirectory> etc.

  Main difference from POSIXApplication is the restriction placed on
  filepaths and removal of filesystem.

  Andreas proposed that this draft moves forward to the JSDL and
  HPCProfile lists for "final call", before submitting to OGF Editor
  for "public comment".

  [Action] - Chris to accept all changes and send "final call" to JSDL
           and HPCProfile lists; allow a period of 5 working days.

  [Action] - Andreas to send to editor (Greg Newby) after end of
             "final call" period

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Review of  "JSDL SPMD Application Extension - v1.0", v4 on GridForge - 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Andreas led discussion of unresolved issues in the Gridforge
  tracker. These issues were submitted by Stephen Pickles and Chris
  Smith.

  - artf5677 
    - Stephen Pickles: make clear to *implementors* that they need to
      setup the environment variables and the command line for the
      invocation, so that the application can be mapped to the local
      system, from the submitted JSDL template.
    - The users should not have to make any special considerations in
      order to map their JSDL request for an SPMD application to the
      underlying system. 
    - In other words, users using this extension should NOT specify a
      wrapper script as the 'Executable' if they use this extension.

  - artf5682 
    - Stephen Pickles: definition of host needs clarification, e.g. "a
      host is a single node in a cluster"

  - artf5671 
    - Chris Smith: Need to clarify the <NumberOfProcesses>
      element. Number of processes should be strictly defined as what
      part of the application they refer to. Proposal is to define
      this element in terms of how many Executable instances will be
      running (how many instances of the executable are to be
      instantiated). 
    - Andreas: Using this proposed definition also makes it clear that
      the user should not specify a wrapper script in the Executable
      (artf5677).

  - artf5672 
    - Chris Smith: ProcessesPerHost, define in terms of the previous
      tracker artifact, i.e., definition of NumberOfProcesses. Chris
      has a problem with the definition of "Processes", which is
      overloaded!  Same resolution as tracker artf5671

  - artf5674 
    - Chris Smith: Implementation of HPCProfile in BES gave rise to
      this tracker issue.
    - Stephen Pickles noted that Mark McKeown has a similar preference
      as Chris. 
    - Andreas: It would be nice to be consistent. Currently using same
      mechanism as JSDL 1.0. Would probably need to change future
      versions for consistency. There is also a related issue that for
      future versions we are likely to move to use the WS-CIM
      generated schemas for such values (e.g., OperatingSystem). Have
      not confirmed yet what form these schemas will take.
      - Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages and it looks
        more like a style decision. 
      - Doing it as a URI has the advantage of not keeping the values
        in the schema, so a schema change is not needed to add values;
        with a URI the specification of these values is only in the
        spec (which can also be a problem).

    - Resolution: Overall it looks like the change to URI for this
      element is preferred. If it does changes to URI, then for
      consistency, future version of the core JSDL will have to change
      to URI for similar definitions. The exception will be
      enumerations that are not owned by JSDL. For those we use
      whatever we are provided by, e.g., WS-CIM.

   [Action] - Steve to get feedback on this resolution from the JSDL
              and ByteIO Lists, before finalisation.

  - artf5675 
    - Including GridMPI introduces an ambiguity in the definition of
      host; it has some fundamental differences from the other MPI
      flavors. (See also later on)

  - artf5683 
    - Agreed to add jsdl-posix:user and add extensibility (open
      content) to this extension

  - artf5676 
    - Specifying number of threads was ruled out of scope in earlier
      discussions. (But see later discussion)

  - artf5681 
    - Stephen Pickles proposal for various patterns for CPUCount.
    - Andreas: Can add custom attributes as an extensibility
      feature. 
    - Agreed that it is too complex to try and address now. For later
      consideration once more experience is gained.

  - artf5678 
    - Stephen Pickles: Add references to specifications, since some
      (e.g. GridMPI) are not well known. Agreed to give a reference to
      the web site or document for each flavor.

  - artf5680 
    - Stephen Pickles: Put in clarification on rank zero processes -
      or is this dodgy? Agreed, after lengthy discussion, that it is
      too complex to try and explain normatively. Instead opt to warn
      users not to assume too much about the semantics of Executable
      and WorkingDirectory. (For Executable the environment should be
      set so that it can be picked up. For WorkingDirectory, a shared
      filesystem may be one assumption, in addition to the rank zero
      proposal).

     Agreed to include a non-normative example with appropriate
     warnings in the doc.

  - artf5679 - Minor issue; skipped. Andreas will fix.

  - artf5673 
    - Chris Smith: suggested adding a number of SPMDVariation values.
    - Andreas: The initial set was not mean to be restrictive. More
      values can and should be added.

    [Action] Andreas to send mail to the list to solicit for values
             once he updates the document with the values given so
             far.

    - Discussed whether to add OpenMP (proposed by Stephen
      Pickles). Introduces the need to describe number of
      threads. This has been ruled out of scope earlier. 
      - Discussed whether it is ok to just use the cpu count as
        implicit value; it is implementation specific and may not be
        what the user wants. It is not uncommon to use more threads
        than CPUs.
     - Andreas: A compromise is to add a NumberOfThreadsPerProcess
       element with type limited to a positive integer; to avoid
       similar questions with the earlier 'power of' discussion.

     Agreed to add a number of threads element

  - General discussion: 
    - Saga-san asked how or whether various configurations could be
      supported by this extension. It is only for a single cluster or
      across various systems?
    - Andreas explained that there is no explicit description of
      configurations supported. One could map to multiple clusters but
      it would be implementation-specific. A way to combine multiple
      JSDL documents and a specification to describe the necessary
      configuration would also be needed (it does not exist right
      now).

  [Action] Andreas and Saga-san: to discuss use cases for specifying
           parallel applications requiring multiple systems and what
           kind of configuration description is needed. (This could be
           another specification that addresses GridMPI requirements
           more explicitly.)
