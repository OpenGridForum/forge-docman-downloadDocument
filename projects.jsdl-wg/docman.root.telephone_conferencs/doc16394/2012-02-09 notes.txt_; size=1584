- second session: BES, GLUE2 and "GLUE-ification"
    -- Should be postponed to a BES-focused session
    -- Using Etienne's proposal of using benchmark units
        -- simple to express in JSDL, but BES instances would have to be hardcoded
        -- If BES should not be hardcoded
    -- The group was not eintirely sure of the consequences
    -- JSDL WG members should look at Etienne's proposal from 22 September "proposal to use benchmarks as units") (JSDL archive)
