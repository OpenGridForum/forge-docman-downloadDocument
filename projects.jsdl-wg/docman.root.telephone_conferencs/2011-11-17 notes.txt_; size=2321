Discuss and agree on a document tree structure

       HPCP, SPMD Application and Parameter Sweep.
==> ACTION Michel to cross check the status of those extensions.

- PW aspires to finish the activity schema specification before Christmas 2011.

       the "Working Drafts" section in the Documents space.
