JSDL-WG GGF10 (Berlin) Session 4
--------------------------------

Friday 12th March 2004, 14:00 - 15:30 (local time)
--------------------------------------------------


Presentation by Ali on JSDL-WG Logistics: See:

https://forge.gridforum.org/projects/jsdl-wg/document/JSDL-WG_GGF10_Session_4_-_JSDL_Deliverables_and_Logistics/en/1

This slide set has been annotated from the meeting's discussions.


JSDL-WG Logistics
=================

o Formal use-cases?
  - Integrated into the specification. (proposed)
  - Darren volunteered to collect the use-cases.
  - NPi use-cases submitted as informational document.

  - Do use-cases to provide documentation on why certain features are 
    included & why something doesn't need to be included (limit scope).

o Use-case collection needs to be done for each area as part of the 
  specification. We need to come up with more scenarios for the general 
  use-cases. Let’s make sure that we keep things simple and if they are 
  complex then we should put in a use-case to indicate why they are 
  required. This is a scenario of one of the use-cases.

o Schema Volunteers:
  - Looking for 4 people (Alain, Steve,....)
  - Volunteers or nominations will be accepted.
  - Make clearer what the work involves:
    - Requirements,
    - Review of other related work to express schema (OWL, XACML, etc.),
    - Actual schema writing.

o Translation tables terms:
  - Start by collecting terms from existing systems.
  - Cross-reference and make sure there is good coverage with current
    proposals (and identify things missing).

  - Look at work of monitoring groups as well (for naming, etc)
    Network Measurements Group?
  - Look at PBS, LSF, Condor, SGE, LoadLeveler initially.

o JSDL Time line: (see presentation slides)

o Teleconfs:
  DoNM: 24th March, 16:00 GMT.
  --- after that : andreas possible teleconf conflict check ---



Presentation by Fred on JSDL Resource attributes: See:

https://forge.gridforum.org/projects/jsdl-wg/document/JSDL-WG_GGF10_Session_4_-_JSDL_Resource_Attributes/en/1


Resource Attributes' Presentation and Discussion
================================================

 o Resource attributes (continued...)

  (...recap from yesterday... March 11th, Session 3...)

   - How to express "want" vs. "need": (e.g. ranges) job needs at least 
     4 nodes but wants 8.
   - This is one of the issues for the schema. Also connection with 
     agreement framework.

 o Check out the Network Measurements WG for the network attributes.

o Executable
  - Ali: Must have an executable.
  - Darren: OK for Type and Name.
  - Staging doesn't require an executable(?)
  - Executable "type": to allow for extension.
  - Perceived overlap with CDDLM; need to work through relationship with 
    them.
    Dan: talk to CDDLM for describing web services as executables in the 
         JSDL. They are defining this already.

  - How to specify 'type' in such a way as to encourage people not to 
    re-define standard 'types'.
    - Be careful not to make assumptions about how will be expressed in 
      the schema, or document them, e.g. is 'type' a string or an element 
      or ....
    - 'string' means free form or is there structure assumed.
  - Executable Type should be narrowed down to prevent clashes.
  - Bill: Why have type for the executable?? What is the use-case for 
          the type.
    - Why is type really needed? use-case -> ClearCase.
  - Why isn't it a JobCategory...?
  - Isn't 'type' just a label/tag?
  - Need to make the usage clearer since it effects the way it should be 
    structured.
  - Would like to leave the 'binding' for late-binding (a type value under 
    executable) rather than early-binding (enumerate executable_xxx in the 
    schema)
  - Bill: List the executable types that you can think of: java, web 
    service, shell, etc. Type will be a string and flexible.

o Argument
  - Ordered list of 0 to many.
  - It could be an XML fragment as well as a String, because an XML 
    fragment is a string.
  - Need to specify in the specification document that there is an order 
    and precedence to the arguments.

  - clarify this in the examples, i.e.
    <argument>arg1 arg2<argument> = "arg1 arg2"

    <argument>arg1<argument> = "arg1"
    <argument>arg2<argument> = "arg2"

o StandardInput
  - rename to 'stdin'

o StandardOutput
  - rename to 'stdout'

o StandardError
  - rename to 'stderr'


o Streaming the output rather than sending it to a file. For data and 
  stdin/out/err.
o Memory to memory data transfer issues.


o Shell
  - Need a "No Shell" value for the Shell attribute?
  - Shell jobs are a type of job and so the Shell attribute should 
    get folded into the job type.

o Log
  - Condor use-case for log file.
  - Notification "never", "on job end", "on job transition", "on job fail"
    Need a notification attribute.

o Have an extra argument to allow for other systems.



Bill on process - Suggestions for future working group sessions at GGFs:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Put the specification document up and go through it rather than making 
   a presentation with same.
2. Put use-cases and examples of usage directly into the specification 
   document.
