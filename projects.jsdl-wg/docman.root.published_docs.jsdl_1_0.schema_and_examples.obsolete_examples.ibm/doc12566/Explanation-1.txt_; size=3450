Hello everyone,
In response to Ali's request, attached for your review are two XML files
that provide an example of how JSDL and WS-Agreement might be used
together. The first XML file is a simple JSDL file that references a
WS-Agreement document by means of a jsdl extension. The second XML file is
a WSAG document based on Example 3 from the latest WS-Agreement draft
specification available for review at
https://forge.gridforum.org/projects/graap-wg/document/WS-AgreementSpecification/en/3
. The resource requirements encapsulated in the second XML file are roughly
based on the 071304_jsdl.xml example that the JSDL-WG posted in the working
group web site.

I've discussed this example with two of the WS-Agreement authors, Asit Dan
and Heiko Ludwig, and they indicated that this example is appropriate and
in conformance with the latest WS-Agreement draft specification.

This example focuses on how WS-Agreement may be used as a means for
specifying resource requirements to be utilized by the resource matching
component of a distributed computing metascheduler. The prioritization of
resource allocation among jobs may be approached in several ways such as
fairness, e.g. first come first serve, efficiency, e.g. shortest job first,
and sophisticated economic models, e.g. auctions. Critical to arbitrated
resource allocation is the concept of job value. One complicating factor is
the possibility that jobs may be executed on a variety of platforms with
differing resources. Therefore the ability to assign different values to
the execution of instances of a job utilizing different resource
alternatives must be explored. For example, a job might be executed on
either a 1GHz processor or a 2GHz processor. Each platform can support the
job, but the job will likely execute more quickly on the faster platform.
The user may indicate a preference for the faster processor over the slower
by assigning a higher relative value to the faster alternative.

The example illustrates a paradigm in which 1) WS-Agreement documents may
encapsulate JSDL resource requirement directives and be used to specify the
business value of jobs in a standardized fashion and as means for users to
specify the relative business value of resource allocation alternatives
within the same job; and  2) JSDL documents may reference WS-Agreement
documents and need contain only the data needed to instantiate a job, such
as permissions, program arguments, environment variables, etc.

Here are the exemplar XML files.
(See attached file: rfjsdl072304.xml)(See attached file: rfwsag072004.xml)

Also, here are 5 schemas that can be used for validation purposes. Please
note that  sdtc.xsd serves as a placeholder for a (hopefully) rich
expression language.

Sorry to get this out so late but I spent several days recovering from a
hard drive failure.
