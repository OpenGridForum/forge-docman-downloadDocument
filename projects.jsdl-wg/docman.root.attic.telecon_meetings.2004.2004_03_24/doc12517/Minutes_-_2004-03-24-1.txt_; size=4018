Discussion:
===========

Administrative:
---------------

   o Discussion of the next phase of work on the schema
     --------------------------------------------------

       Attribute Updates:
       ------------------
     - All authors to revise attributes following feedback from GGF10.
         Use GGF10 meeting minutes.
     - Follow new tabular format for the spec?
     - Deadline for updates by the end of the month???


       Use-cases and Examples:
       -----------------------
     - Include ***use-cases*** and ***examples*** (in XML if helpful) 
       and ***any-other-information*** for clarification, for the 
       attributes in the relevant sections, if necessary.


       Effort Re-allocation:
       ---------------------
     - Fred to come off the Scheduling attributes work to help An 
       with the Resource attributes section.
     - Lee to come off the Security attributes work and start to look at
       OWL, XACML, etc. and tools for the XML schema.

 o Potentially, Lee to work on the schema.
 o Stephan G., to work on the schema.
 o The current authors to work on the schema.
 o Alain Andrieux, to work on the schema (reviewer).

Comments:
---------
Question: Will the schema be done to discuss at GGF11?
  Answer: That should be the aim.

Lee: Making schema generic. i.e. executables as web-services, etc.
     use <any>.


Specification:
--------------
Resource Section:
-----------------

host
----
o If more than one attribute exists, i.e. 2 Hosts, and if we require to
  specify an order of preference, then the schema should be explicit in 
  specifying that order. That is, do not rely on the order of appearance of 
  the attributes in the JSDL document.


Digression from the Resource Section of the Specification:
----------------------------------------------------------

Job Definition
--------------
o Suggestion: That the JSDL expresses a job template and that there is no 
              connection to a running job instance.

  - So Job ID, which reflects the running job status, does not belong in the 
    JSDL, according to the above definition.

o Should, therefore, push the personal ID and resource usage, and idea of 
  JSDL representing an instance of a running job out of the JSDL - to a 
  higher level(?).

o The JSDL then becomes a template language. A list of requirements for a 
  job.


Concluding:
-----------
o Job template vs. Job instance description...
  - Job template wins...

o Simple resource requirements or a complex resource requirement.
  - absolute requirements

Question: What are we defining?
  Answer: A set of attributes and the language for defining the 
          relationship between them.

 o Refer back to the charter.

 o Will need a set of operators to express preference between attributes, 
     and 
 o Will need a set of operators to express the specified value of the 
     attributes.

Question: introduce these operators in the JSDL?
  Answer: can do, see JDML for e.g.

Asit: to give a talk on Agreement/Guarantee to JSDL on Wed. 7th April and 
      to send us e-mail introduction (abstract) for the agenda in advance.


AOB:
----
Dan: Now that we are doing templates not job instance descriptions, what 
     about parametric jobs, a la SGE (refer to SGE man page for qsub)

Chris: Also in LSF terms for the SOAP interface - will send doc to list.
