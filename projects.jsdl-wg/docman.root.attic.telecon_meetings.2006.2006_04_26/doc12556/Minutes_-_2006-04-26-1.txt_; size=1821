Parallel Job Type Extension to JSDL v1.0:
-----------------------------------------

Session 1:
----------
  - BSC examples
    [Ali: Contact Ivan R. to put together a presentation for us]

  - NAREGI examples
    [Saga San: Presentation of NAREGI examples and demo of middleware behaviour]

  - Chris Smith and Platform, resurrect the topology discussions
    (mostly contained on the list)
    [Andreas: contact Chris for material]

  - Examples from other projects or stakeholders (solicit from JSDL list?)
    (allow overflow to Session 2)
    [Steve: simple examples from IC]
    [Michel: previous examples]


Session 2:
 ----------
  - Summarise requirements for Parallel Job Type Extension.
      What are the use cases we must support by this extension?
      What are the use cases we are leaving out?

    [If we have more time]

  - Schema proposals?
      Review existing proposals to determine how far they meet
      requirements, e.g., BSC

  - BES and ESI (Execution Service Interfaces) discussion:
      Extensions to JSDL rather than wrapper to contain job state info etc.

  - IBM work proposed by Jay U. discussed in ad hoc meeting with a view of 
    planning a formal session for GGF18.



Primer:
-------
  - Strawman needed
      Need a document that captures a set of JSDL document examples and 
      their expected interpretations so that we can test the compliance 
      of systems (BES containers?) and JSDL parsers - make into an 
      experiences doc to get formal recommendation status for JSDL1.0?
