Technical:
----------

Following last week's telecon (28th Feb 2004)
---------------------------------------------

o Lee:
 - An's resources attributes: MinMaxVal, still covered or updated?
 - Fred's discussion: iCalendar (only 3 temporal attributes)
   - Darren: should reference iCalendar, not re-invent the wheel.

o Fred: 'ImmediateRun' - Lee thought need for this, but, 
        Fred sees no use-case right now.
o Lee: Time that job is submitted as time to run the job is a bit 
       uncertain because of clock synchronisation issue etc.
o Steve: 3 types of job submission:

         "run now",
         "run at time x", 
         "run whenever"

o Fred: JobStartTrigger attribute?

 - We should put a place-keeper for 'ImmediateRun' as an attribute 
   into the JSDL.


o Asit: WS-Agreement - Guarantee spec, for JSDL


Status Check of Work:
---------------------
o Ali: Apologies, JobID not updated since Dec. but will be for review 
       at GGF10

o Fred: Scheduling attr category, good coverage of the attributes.
        No additional attributes since last release. 
        Definitions still open to work. Need detail and to expand cases.

o An: No top level descriptions or use-cases.
      MinMaxVal - Lee, range and range values,
         - combine min max into a single attribute
      Need to handle the requirements of sophisticated DRMs.

o Andreas: Data attributes are with Steve.
o Steve: Will have a look and comment.

o Security: Lee to work with Darren to try and understand the 
            security work impact on JSDL and JSDL's requirements 
            for security attributes. Will report back when possible.


JSDL Focus:
-----------
o Ali: We need to look at the language, vocabulary, not grammar yet.
o Steve: Agree, look at the vocabulary of the JSDL.

  - Agreement that we should find vocabulary.

  - can still have sideline discussions regarding the way to use 
    the JSDL and its structure and feed back once attributes are defined 
    and consistent.


o Asit: attributes to describe how the work went on, job status?
o Darren, Ali: Outwith the scope of JSDL, down to implementation and other 
               specs.


AOB:
----

o Andreas: Not going to make the call next week. Tuesday OGSA f2f
           Andreas would like JSDL slides for OGSA f2f reviewed.
           Ali has agreed to do this, if furnished with slides in time.

o Asit: exploit synergy between WGs, status update on WS-Agreement 
        before GGF10?
o Asit: Guarantee and JSDL. Send an e-mail on the list, focus on 
        service term and what a guarantee means. To expand on GRAAP 
        and WS-Agreement terminology to aid our understanding.

o Steve: Report from GRAAP f2f - in depth discussion, not necessarily 
         directed at JSDL, but some work will concern us.

o Steve: to set up the meeting with CIM folks at GGF10.
