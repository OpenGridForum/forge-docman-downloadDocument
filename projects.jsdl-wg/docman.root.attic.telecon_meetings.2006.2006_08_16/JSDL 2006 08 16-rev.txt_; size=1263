Agenda:

OGSA F2F fall-out
GGF18 Planning

OGSA F2F:
---------

Discussed developments from the OGSA F2F. How the resource
requirements are being addressed in the Information Model by Ellen et
al. In the short term JSDL-WG will monitor, and participate as needed,
in work being done in BES, HPCP and OGSA.
- BES - container modeling
- HPCP - extension to JSDL 1.0 for XQuery and also a cut-down version
  of POSIXApplication
- OGSA - overall architectural picture 

Some of these would probably go in a 1.1 (incl errata); other work
requiring structural changes will be folded into a 2.0 at a later
time.

Steve and Andreas will be looking how to map existing stuff to the
description+requirements approach being proposed.
