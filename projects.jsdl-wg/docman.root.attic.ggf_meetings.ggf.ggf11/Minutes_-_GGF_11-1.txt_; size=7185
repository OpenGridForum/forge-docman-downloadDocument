JSDL-WG Meeting Minutes
-----------------------
GGF11 (Honolulu)
----------------
Sessions 1 to 5
---------------

Session 1 - Monday 7th June 2004, 12:30 - 14:00 (Local Time)
============================================================

Darren - Introduction to JSDL-WG work at GGF11 and our goals for this meeting.

Steve - General introductory overview of JSDL and our aims.

Darren - Explanation of rules of engagement - we are going to go through the 
         specification and discuss each section in detail.

       - JSDL descriptions are for job templates!

Diving into the Spec.
---------------------

Introduction:
-------------
JSDL categories:

  Discussing Basic Scheduling requirements:
    Gone. Pushing to outside the JSDL. e.g. to OGSA's EMS. Don't need this 
    for job templates.

  Discussing Security requirements:
    Gone. Pushing to outside the JSDL. e.g. to OGSA's EMS. Don't need this 
    for job templates.

  Adding paragraph to spec about security and scheduling needs being outside 
  the scope of JSDL.

Q: Is the JSDL atomic?
A: Not atomic.

Delete Sub-sections 3.1 to 3.3

Asit - question about Agreement - should re-use the Agreement and Guarantee 
       terms' constraint schema.

We should write a primer companion for the JSDL's normative schema and put 
all context info there.

Attributes:
-----------
  Insert JobName in addition to JobAnnotation

  Take out mutability because the JSDL doc is a template job description.

  Move usage of attributes to the primer.

  Remove SubmissionUserName attribute, since JSDL is a template doc.

  Change ExecutionUserName to describe the ID of the user under whose 
  ID the job is executed.

  Need a UserGroupName that is like the gid of a user, and, have an 
  ExecutionUserGroupName to define the non-computing group id of a 
  job.


Session 2 - Tuesday 8th June 2004, 12:30 - 14:00 (Local Time)
=============================================================

Disscussion of Group attributes:
--------------------------------
  ExecutionUserName
  ExecutionUserGroupName
  UserGroupName
  JobGroupName

Chris - move ExecutionUserName to ExecutionUserID, which should contain the 
        userID and the groupID of the user.

Discussion of UserGroup and JobGroup and JobProject names:
  removed UserGroupName
  kept JobProjectName
    will edit later...

JobCategory - kept... 

Darren - summarising list of JobID attributes.


Moving onto Job Resources:
--------------------------
Host - 
  host name or IP address?
  host vs. abstract resource - Host attribute can be both.
  affinity removed.

"The Preference Mechanism":
  Need a generic preference clause in the spec regarding how one specifies 
  the priority of a list of an attribute. "The preference mechanism".

CPU - 
  Taken out Count from CPU.

  Chris - Count is independent from the CPU. Chris to send e-mail on count 
  to the list.

The major issue is that the attributes are interrelated and that a number of 
attributes are not independent and should be specified on a per CPU or a per 
host level.

We should work on the fact that we are addressing attributes for a single job 
that runs on a physical host.

PhysicalMemory - 

Network - 
  do we need this?
  OK, leave it in.

Discussion of JSDL-WG telecon times - defer...


Session 3 - Tuesday 8th June 2004, 16:00 - 17:30 (Local Time)
=============================================================

Discussion of telecon times - alternate between 13:00 GMT and 21:00 GMT 
every week. This way folks can attend at least one session a week.

Continue discussion of the spec's resource attributes:
------------------------------------------------------
FileSystemSpace - 

HostUsage - 
  changed to ExclusiveExecution

All resource attributes can be specified for a host, so put all inside 
the Host attribute and can then specify multiple hosts with specific 
resource requirements for those hosts to provide flexibility in the language.

Env Vars - 

Software Requirements:
----------------------
OperatingSystem - 

VirtualMemory - 
  changed to ProcessVirtualMemoryLimit

Added JobVirtualMemoryLimit

Priority - 
  struck out.

CPUTimeLimit - 
  specify time units?
  use Usage Record units.

WallTimeLimit - 
  ditto as above...

ProcessQueue - 
  changed to Queue.

Chris - send an e-mail to the list for all of the software requirements 
        for OS limits...

Application Requirements:
-------------------------
Executable - 
  add 'name' property.

Arguement - 

StdOut, StdIn, StdErr - 
  change to (0..n)


Session 4 - Wednesday 9th June 2004, 10:00 - 11:30 (Local Time)
===============================================================

Starting with File in Data Section:
-----------------------------------
File - 

  FileSystemName is causing problems. What is the need for this?
  FileSystemSpace requirement in the resources section is not clear.
  Will come back to address these issues.

  Target {0..n} is a _list_, so that the file is staged out to ALL of the 
  Targets.

  Source {0..n} is a _choice_, so that the file is staged from ANY of the 
  Sources.

  Changed Overwrite (and Append) to CreationFlag that is an enumeration 
  type with values {overwrite, append, prepend}.

Start an issues list, as a tracker and in the document (Andreas to help?).

Discussion of multiple host/CPU requirements:
---------------------------------------------
Chris - introduces the LSF case - sent to the list.

 - Trying to bash out a schema to address the issue.

We are at the right stage to start to write the schema to match the spec 
currently, then float on the list and to start to write JSDL docs to 
suite our use-cases, and then suggest improvements to the schema that 
would then feed back to the spec.

Session 5 - Wednesday 9th June 2004, 12:45 - 14:15 (Local Time)
===============================================================

Steve - Going through preliminary xsd schema.

Unit specifications will be taken from Usage Record-WG.

Steve is typing an example JSDL doc while we come up with a JSDL schema for 
an example of a job description for a job request.

Andreas - we should write up in English what this example JSDL doc is 
encapsulating/describing.

This JSDL example doc will be used by Steve to produce a preliminary xsd 
schema for the JSDL.

This preliminary schema will then be sent out on the list with the example 
JSDL doc that it was derived from. Others will be encouraged to write 
use-case job descriptions using the schema and give the group feedback and 
requirements.

FileSystem attribute is causing problems. It is not completely clear what 
requirement this attribute is addressing.

Fred - the attributes under HostType are restricting the Hosts that can run 
       the job. You can specify a number of HostNames under each HostType.

       Can also make these restrictions under the Job, HostType, and 
       HostName levels.

Ping Jim Pruyne of GRAAP to find out about constraints mechanisms from 
WS-Agreement or WS-Policy, i.e. our "preference mechanism".

Need to add FileSystemName for each File, which is linked to the FileSystem 
in the resources section.

Borrow logical operations from Agreement? OWL?
