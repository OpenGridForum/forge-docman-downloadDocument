>    2. Activity instance document specification

  [x] Andreas to review doc and accept changes

> DOCUMENT:
> - Clarification of terminology: activity versus activity
>   instance. The former is what the user/application/client/... wants
>   to have executed. The latter is generated according to this
>   specification. Check whole document for consistency. Introduce
>   terms.

  [-] Check for consistency and description of terms (andreas)

   in progress...
   
  [x] Delete glossary at the back (andreas)

> - Enumeration of figures (3 is missing).

  [x] Check and fix (andreas)
 
> - De-bold all references to references.

  [x] Remove references from captions (andreas)

> - Do we provide Annex B (If not, adjust Section 3)

  [-] One for initial Activity instance entry and one with usage
      records and so on (philipp)

> - What was the decision re. Section 4? Fill or delete?

  [x] Delete (andreas) 

> - Is 5.10.6 example correct?

  [x] Change URI to tempuri.org   (andreas)

> - Adjust 6.2.5 to 6.1.5?

  [-] Adjust the JSDL example to fit the UR (probably easier)
  [-] adjust the UR example to make sense (e.g., recent date)

> - Insert missing references.

  [-] (philipp)

> XSD:
> - Link to the OGF/W3C location of schemata, not the local ones.

  [-] (philipp)

> - Take special care re UR URL!

  [-] (philipp)

> - Check XSD versus specification.

  [-] Change the element names in the XSD for the ogf specs to match
      those used in the spec (philipp)

> - THEN add XSD to Annex A.

  [-] When the document is done (philipp)

- Other discussion

  [x] Fix the footer:  example@ggf.org -> jsdl-wg (andreas)

- UR section
  - history entry order cannot be relied on, it might be different from the UR
  - Need to reason based on  start / end fields of UR record

  [x] Andreas to add some explanatory text to the spec 

- Security section 

  [x] Could add signatures overall and/or on individual entries. Minor
      rewrite to describe both possibilities (andreas)
