o Andreas: Produce the spec sections in parallel and upload to GridForge as 
           seperate documents. when ready to submit to GGF as draft, Andreas

Discussion of Attr. Properties:
-------------------------------

    - Requirement of Attributes
      -------------------------
o Compulsory Attrs.: minimum multiplicity of 1
  - must be in all JSDL instance documents

o All other Attrs.: in a JSDL doc are 'required'
  - must be scheduled and satisfied.

o Optional Attrs. are out!

o The 'source' of required attributes (i.e. user, system, etc.) is out of 
  JSDL scope.


    - multiplicity of attributes
      --------------------------
o Attributes can appear, according to the spec,
 -  0 or more times
 -  1 or more times
 -  or an exact number of times


( Sideline discussion:
  --------------------
  (JSDL doc is a description for a job-node in a workflow, 
     i.e. granularity of 'job' is a job-node not a whole workflow)
  (JSDL describes dependancies on the outputs and status of immediately 
     relevant jobs - using a scheduling attribute)


    - negotiability of attributes
      ---------------------------
o Do we allow mutability of attribute values?
o JSDL can change for mutability before submission! (Steve)
o JSDL doc can be dynamic until the negotiation cycle is complete. (Alain)
o So the JSDL document is not ready for submission until both requestor 
  and provider are happy with it, re: negotiation.

o We need to decide at what stage the JSDL doc becomes validated.
o Lots of questions need answering!


    - value types for attribute values
      --------------------------------
o In Steve's hands.
o Question: How strongly typed do we want JSDL to be? (Steve)
   Loosely typed -> no validation required
   Tightly typed -> validation not only of type, but also of the value and
                    range

o Start with loosely typed???
o Steve to e-mail list on this.
