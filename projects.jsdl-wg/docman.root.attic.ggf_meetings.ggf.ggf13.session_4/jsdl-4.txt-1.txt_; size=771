- Get rid of all String types?

- Ranges implicitly defines operators, i.e. between 'a' and 'b'

- All operator attributes on the elements go away, no need for operators

- ProcessCount should be (?) implicit to the description of the application, 
  so this should, perhaps, appear in the application type specific definition?

  NAREGI have requirement for ProcessCount for MPI server.

  HAVE TAKEN OUT ProcessCount for now.

- Resource is a set of resources the number of which is given by the 
  ResourceCount. The HostName is an array of allowed hosts.
  - CPUCount is the number of CPUs for eache resource.

- Discuss on list which resource constraints are global total constraints, 
  i.e. over the whole job regardless of the number of processes and resources.
