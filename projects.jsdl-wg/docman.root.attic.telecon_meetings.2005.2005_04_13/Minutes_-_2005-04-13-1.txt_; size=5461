Agenda & Minutes
----------------

 0) UID/GID

   - POSIX UID and GID in the POSIX Application section. (Open Q: username vs. userID)

   - Action: Donal to bring the open question to list


 1) Fig. 1 revision

   - Action: Andreas


 2) Fig. 2 revision

   - Action: Andreas


 3) Prefixes and namespaces (check and update)

   - waiting on Greg Newby and GFSG.

   - Action: Michel to ensure that his recommended namespace is 
     consistent throughout the spec (i.e. not to wait on Greg and GFSG).


 4) Namespace should be in the table (and update)

   - DONE


 5) Section 3 (spec doc) general revision and polishing up

   - To be done...

   - Action: Andreas

   - Owners for: Glossary
               : Extending JSDL


 6) Update explanation for jsdl:other usage

   - jsdl:other is the value for e.g. other arch and OS name etc.

   - Have defined this and behaviours - have to be able to process it and must reject the 
     document if can't be processed.

   - To add extra information that is allowed to be ignored if can't be processed, but, 
     jsdl:any can't be ignored.

   - Section 4.2 - placeholder (maybe better in the Extending JSDL section).


 7) Possibly reformat ch. 4.2.1, 4.2.2.1, 4.2.2.2

   - Bulleted list to tables

   - Action: Andreas


 8) JSDL compliance levels
    How much of jsdl a system must support, not just process.
    Probably a topic for later.

   - Placeholder, will come up later!

   - Action: Michel


 9) The statement "If not supported then the consuming system MUST reject
    the document." needs a bit more explanation or re-write.

   - Related to number 8 above.

   - Refer to notational convention

   - Action: Michel


10) When/why did HostName change from 0-1 to 0-n? (reverted)

   - It didn't!

   - Action: Andreas to follow up on the list.


11) Filesystem name and type and filesystem reference in DataStaging

   - This needs to be specified? Needs more explanation?

   - Action: Andreas


12) Mountpoint environment variable. Is the current approach ok, or
    should we provide a separate mechanism, e.g, a tag that if present
    provides the name of the environment variable in which the
    MountPoint value must be present.

   - If a Mountpoint environment variable is not specified, then the name 
     of the filesystem is used for the value of the env var.

   - Action: ALL to review spec section 5.5.12 and get back to the list

   - Issue to be discussed on the list.


13) Should FileSystemID be changed (back) to FileSystemName.

   - This is done already.


14) DRMAA use case for defining filenames. We have to at least be able
    to show an example of how to define and stage out an <Output> file.

   - Action: Andreas

   - Action: Donal to suggest alternative


15) CreationFlag. Was this made optional or not? Confirm and delete
    comment.

   - Not optional. Andreas to make spec consistent.
     4.2.2.4  File Creation Flags (jsdl:CreationFlagEnumeration)
          - Get rid of "Prepend"


16) Process Topology needs review. In particular are the examples ok or
    not, are the definition correct and so on. Delete the yellow
    comments once that is done. Not sure if we should define the precise
    allocation behaviour or allow for that to be defined instead.

   - Action: ALL to review this section (Section 6 in 0.9.5-01).
       - ProcessCount to be put back into POSIX Application.
       - ProcessCountLimit in the POSIX Application.


17) Section "Extending JSDL" needs an owner. I expect this section to be
    about 1 page long so should not be too much trouble.

   - Action: Steve (with Michel as wingman)


18) Normative Extension is out of place

   - Action: Andreas.


19) re-check terminology for process topology and delete comments

   - Part of 16 Review


20) "Bytes (octets of bits)"

   - Delete!

   - Put into Glossary.


21) Memory limit incomplete text

   - Action: Donal - Extra text


22) pipe size limit incomplete text

   - Action: Donal - Extra text


23) Update of security considerations in line with latest decisions
    (when we actually reach firm decision)

   - User and Group ID decisions finalised, then make clear statements 
     about security.


24) Complete author information (see my entry as reference)

   - Leave to last... Placeholder


25) Update contributors and acknowledgements

   - Leave to last... Placeholder


26) Complete list of Normative references, e.g., CIM is still missing.

   - Leave to last... Placeholder

     CIM = http://www.dmtf.org/standards/cim/


27) Glossary owner

   - Action: Ali


28) Translation tables need to be added
    Proposal: Karl for Globus/GRAM,
              Chris for LSF,
              Saga-san for Naregi,
              ??? for Condor,
              ...

   - See below...

28a) Put the translation tables into a separate document?

   - Non-normative information docs

   - Steve and GridSAM to input GRAM and Condor

   - Template for these docs needed.


29) Promised examples for the appendix
   (But maybe this should be split off into a Primer)

   - Put examples into a primer...


30) Make citations in text of document reference real cross-references.

   - Action: Andreas


31) Complete example sub-sections

   - Need examples for elements.


32) POSIXApplication/Executable: optional or mandatory?

   - Bring to list.
