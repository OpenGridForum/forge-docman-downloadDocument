===========

Administrative:
---------------

o Ali: propose that authors volunteer to take responsibility for attributes 
       in each of the proposed categories, as Ali has done for the Job ID 
       category.

       This should facilitate the induction of each of the attribute sets 
       and distribute the work load of writing and editing each of the 
       categories and their respective attribute sets.

       The categories and attribute sections are:

       6.1.1   Job Identity Attributes 6
       6.1.1.1 Job ID  6
       6.1.1.2 Job Owner       6
       6.1.1.3 Job Owner Group 6
       6.1.1.4 Job Project     6
       6.1.1.5 Job Type        6
       6.1.1.6 Job Identity Attributes Summary 6

       6.1.2   Resource Attributes     6
       6.1.2.1 Hardware Requirements   7
       6.1.2.2 Environment Variables   7
       6.1.2.3 Software Requirements   7
       6.1.2.4 Application Requirements        7
       6.1.2.5 Argument List   7
       6.1.2.6 Resource Attributes Summary     7

       6.1.3.1 Databases       7
       6.1.3.2 Data Files      7
       6.1.3.3 Data Formats    7
       6.1.3.4 Data Transportation     7
       6.1.3.5 Data Attributes Summary 7

       6.1.4   Scheduling Attributes   7
       6.1.4.1 Temporal Dependencies   7
       6.1.4.2 Data Dependencies       7
       6.1.4.3 Job Dependencies        7
       6.1.4.4 Accounting Attributes   7
       6.1.4.5 Scheduling Attributes Summary   7

       6.1.5   Security Attributes     7
       6.1.5.1 Security Scheme 8

o Fred and An: Take on the "Scheduling Attributes" and "Resource Attributes".

o Andreas S.: Would like to volunteer, but, doesn't know which category at 
              the moment.

o Ali: "Job Identity Attributes".

o Alain: Will have a shot at the "Security Attributes", though he's no 
         expert. Not many attributes(?)


JSDL Job ID Attributes:
-----------------------

o UserGroupName

  Andreas S. - What is the difference between this and JobGroupName?
  Ali - Could submit a job as user with group 'A', the job group could 
        belong to group 'B'.
  Andreas H. - What are the mappings to concrete systems? Examples?
               We should address commonalities between different systems.
  Ali - Action: To find out the common areas for group attributes between 
        different systems.


o JobGroupName

  Fred - 'Group', should be accounting attribute?


o JobProjectName

  Dan - JobProjectName and UserGroupName are accounting attributes, not 
         sure about JobGroupName.
  Fred - Use JobProjectName for access control and accounting, and policy 
         control.
