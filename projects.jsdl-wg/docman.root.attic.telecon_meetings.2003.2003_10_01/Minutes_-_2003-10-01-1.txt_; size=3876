--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rotation of Telecon Times:
--------------------------

Ali: Propose rotation of telecon meeting times after every four telecons.
     This would give everyone fair share of the less social hours.

     Propose the times for the next set of four telecons to be:

       California      - 06:00
       Chicago         - 08:00
       New York        - 09:00
       UK              - 14:00
       Mainland Europe - 15:00
       Japan           - 22:00 (23:00 after Oct 26th)

     The telecons will be on Wednesdays as usual and the next set will 
     begin shortly after GGF9, suggest 15th October as first one.

ALL: No objections were noted.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
JSDL Spec Work:
---------------

Ali: Suggest a Work Plan where, the JSDL attribute set is broken down into 
     a number of categories that are presented as subsections in the JSDL 
     specification doc. The categories are for example:

       o Job ID Requirements
       o Hardware Requirements
       o Software Requirements
       o Security Requirements
       o File and Data IO Requirements
       o etc.

     Then fill each category with a number of attributes, starting, perhaps, 
     with the set in the Job Terms Proposal.

     Then tackle each category at a time, with ALL contributing at the same 
     time. Each category will be discussed for, say, two weeks, before 
     moving onto the next. We can always come back to the categories we have 
     left behind, because their time was up, at a later stage.

     This plan should ensure that everyone (all batch language/system 
     consultants) contribute to each category and so the requirements for 
     all the languages out there are covered by the set of attributes in 
     each category. It will also ensure that the work gets done in 
     manageable chunks so that no one feels overloaded all at once.

     Ali to present this work-plan at the 1st JSDL-WG meeting at GGF9.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agenda for Sessions One and Two of JSDL-WG at GGF9:
---------------------------------------------------

Session One: (Tue. Oct 7th, 4:00 pm - 5:30 pm)
------------

* Outreach - Present Overview of JSDL-WG

  o Motivation
  o Positioning
  o Deliverables
  o etc.

* Present Telecon Schedule

* Present Work Plan

* Check list of language/system consultants

* Present JSDL Spec Doc Structure and Discuss
  (includes the discussion of the high level JSDL structure)


Session Two: (Wed. Oct 8th, 12:00 pm - 13:30 pm)
------------

This session will include discussions on:

i.  The OGSA Program Execution Architecture,
    presented by Ming Xu (Platform)

ii. The WS-Agreement Negotiation Framework and the "Job Terms Proposal" from 
    the Platform-Globus collaboration,
    presented by Karl Czajkowski (ISI) and Alain Andrieux (ISI)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Relation of the Job Terms Proposal to the JSDL Spec:
----------------------------------------------------

o The Job Terms Proposal is not the JSDL Spec.

o It is a proposal for a set of job description requirement attributes 
  AND a JSDL structure that builds on top of the proposed WS-Agreement 
  Negotiation Framework and its terms language infrastructure.

o The Job Terms Proposal will be discussed at GGF9 and if accepted as a 
  JSDL informational document, will feed into the JSDL specification.
