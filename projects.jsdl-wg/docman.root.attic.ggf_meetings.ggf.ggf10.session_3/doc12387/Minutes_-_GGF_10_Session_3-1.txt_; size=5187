Resource Attributes' Presentation and Discussion
================================================

 o Specifying the attributes for hardware and software requirements.

 o Sources considered:
   - Job submission on traditional operating systems,
   - OGSA and Globus' RSL,
   - DRMs: PBS, Condor, Maui, Platform LSF, (SUN) Grid Engine,
   - Feedback from JSDL mailing list,
   - Computer Associates' Job Scheduling Software

 o Should consider further sources:
   - LoadLeveler,
   - FlowTracerNC (www.rtda.com),
   - Grid Job Language (Fraunhofer Institute),
   - DataSynapse,
   - XRSL (Poznan).


o Host
  - Order and priority of hosts to consider for scheduling?
  -  Darren: don't attach policy for now. Just say that it is an ordered 
     list!
     - Ordered list is not required, the WS-Policy stuff can be used to 
       help prioritise it.
     - Remember that this refers to a single job running on any or all of 
       the hosts.
  - Chris and Dan: leave it as it is, i.e. not ordered list.
  - Chris: Refer back to the Job Terms document for priority of hosts.
  --> OPEN ISSUE

o CPU
  - "negation" and "wild-cards" and other operators for JSDL schema.
  - Other metrics to CPU speed for machine performance, e.g. number of 
    transactions?
  - Extensibility set for this: ComplexAttributes from SGE, HostTypes 
    (general resource attributes) from LSF.

o PhysicalMemory
  - Typing "256M", "256k", etc. if the type is string.
  - Will address typing in the specification and the schema work.

o Network
  - Move to "data attributes"? Because you're specifying a source and 
    destination.
  - We need to think about the use of the network for the network 
    attributes.
  - Look at use-cases for this and where the network attributes belong in 
    JSDL.
  - Chris: this stuff is important for resource management.
  - Need for remote visualisation and computational steering.

o FileSystem
  - Change the name since this attribute is referring to directories and 
    directory structures, not AFS, NFS, etc.
  - SwapSpace - identified differently on some systems, e.g. Windows 
    requires paging space.
  - Set the multiplicity for each of DiskSpace and SwapSpace and TempSpace
  - Set cardinality of the three attributes.
  - Set units on each of the three attributes.

o EnvironmentVariable
  - Specify type for "String"="String", for <EnvVar>=<Value>
  - Inheritance of environment values, put into specification? Shall we 
    say that the Environment variables can be inherited, e.g. from 
    submission environment.
  - Can specify predefined environments - Need a way to specify predefined 
    environments? This maybe fulfilled through the job category.
  - OR do we specify all of the environment variables explicitly. i.e. 
    leave the predefined environments to be described in JSDL by a higher 
    level system.

o OperatingSystem
  - Tackling operations including wild-cards etc. in the schema work.

o VirtualMemory
  - Need units. Include in the typing.

o ProcessVirtualMemory
  - Per process value? Should be the aggregate i.e. per job.
  - Min, Max, Exact issue needs to be addressed.
  - Chris: request for shell/OS limits.
  - Telecon for Min, Max, Exact and whether these limits are for the OS or 
    the shell or the scheduling system.

o ProcessPriority
  - "execution environment" definition? Target machine? Machine and OS?
  - For OS or for scheduler?

o ProcessCoreDumpSize
  - If not defined then max dump limit, OS or shell limit?

o ProcessFileSize
  - Leave because OS10 has this.


o Put in a limit on each output file for the job in the data attributes 
  category.
o Data Attributes should include the created output files and can have 
  limits(?).


o ProcessCPUTime
  - Revisit "process" prefixes on the attributes' names, since this stuff 
    applies to 'jobs' not 'processes'.

o ProcessWallTime
  - Equivalent attribute for "I want it done by", in scheduling 
    attributes.


o No default values for the attributes - leave to the implementation on 
  all attributes!


o ProcessQueue
  - Revisit the use-cases for this.


Process Attributes
------------------
 - Is it a per process value? Not a sum of the aggregation of the 
   processes if the job has more than one process?
 - We need to put in shell limits and also a resource. This discussion 
   needs to be moved to a phone discussion in the near future.
 - ProcessPriority = We need "nice" values for the running machine and the 
   scheduling priority as well.
 - Process File Time needs to be defined because of X10.
 - We need to add something to the data transfer and file size as well.
 - We need to change the names in the Process Attributes area and take 
   out the "Process" prefixes.
 - Process Queues needs to be supported for the machine. We need to look 
   at the use-cases for this again.
