 - Possible JSDL meeting to go with the OGSA F2F meeting in London.
   Wed. 25th May 2005.

 - Change the spec so that elements which are defined by child elements 
   must have those elements in them, while elements that have parent 
   elements can also exist outside the parent element.

Agenda & Minutes
----------------

16) Process Topology needs review. In particular are the examples OK or
    not, are the definition correct and so on. Delete the yellow
    comments once that is done. Not sure if we should define the precise
    allocation behaviour or allow for that to be defined instead.

    - Action: ALL to review Steve and Donal's suggestion on the mailing 
              list.

CONSIDER:

Karl + Today's telecon:

 <jsdl:Resources>
    <jsdl:TotalCPUs>jsdl:rangeValue</jsdl:TotalCPUs> ?
    ... other totals for RAM, VM, etc. ...
    <jsdl:Resource>
       <jsdl:Count>jsdl:rangeValue</jsdl:Count> ?
       <jsdl:CPUs>jsdl:rangeValue</jsdl:CPUs> ?
       ... other per-resource constraints ...
    </jsdl:Resource> *
 </jsdl:Resources> ?

  0-1 Resources clauses since a job may have none?
  0-N Resource clauses per Resources because it may have only
      "global" constraints


31) Complete example sub-sections

    - Need examples for elements.

32) Requirement for a "4 CPU machine" vs. "4 CPUs on A machine".

Add a new "node=true|false" attribute to the <Resource> element 
only. This then specifies that the requirements in this element 
are on the machine and are not the min. requirements for the job.

CONSIDER:

<Resource node="true">
  <CPUCount><exact>2.0</exact></CPUCount>

  <PhysicalMemory>
    <exact>1073741824.0</exact>
  </PhysicalMemory>
</Resource>
