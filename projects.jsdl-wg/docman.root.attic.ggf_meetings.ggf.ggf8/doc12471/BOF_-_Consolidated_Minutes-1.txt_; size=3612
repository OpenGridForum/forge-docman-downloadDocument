Ali's Presentation
------------------
About a third of the audience were present at the JSDL BoF at GGF7, Tokyo.

o Presentation of the charter,
o motivation for JSDL,
o positioning within GGF wrt DRMAA, GRAAP, other,
o deliverables,
o list of systems to consider
o interested parties


Charter Discussion:

o Question: Why is there a need for a JSDL Translator.
  Answer: To allow the JSDL to retrofit existing job description languages
          and to allow for proprietary system languages in future.

o Question: How does the JSDL cater for batch system vendor extensions.
  Answer: Through an extensibility mechanism, to be scoped.

o Question: Will the JSDL include an aspect of Job control.
  Answer: Perhaps it will provide the ability to specify that job control is required.

o Question: Is the JSDL like JCL?
  Answer: Could be a starting point.


Examples of RDL features should be considered (RDL not to be included - hope to import one)

o Do not need a full RDL.
o WG aim is to focus on relationship between resources and needs, NOT capturing resource description.
o Will only look at RDL to the extent that the WG will set requirements for another group.
o Should clarify charter on this point.

Discussion -
o is there a need to include some RDL features in the language?
o is there a need for a framework but leaving the details and keywords out.
o could do the framework and some subset of keywords? Perhaps?
o could include a tag to identify the RDL so can plug and play?

Proposal:
1. Choose a resource scope that is sufficient
2. Define a language sufficient to meet the scope

In defining RDL you should provide translation definitions to existing product resource 
definitions, i.e. a translation table.

Migration issues in the future when RDL is filled out


o The JSDL will not address workflow.

o Will need to liaise with GRAAP-WG as they can make use of JSDL.

o Added translation table for JSDL attributes to the list of deliverables.


o Fred Maciel to send out suggested times for telecons.


o List of volunteers to act as consultants on various batch/scheduling systems.

Extensibility of JSDL - 
o extensibility will be one of the biggest issues that we need to work on.
o consensus will be important or the JSDL will not be adopted.
o could extend to describe Grid Service resources.
o propose JSDL core set with an extension mechanism for extensions set.
o must satisfy vendor concerns by defining extension mechanisms.
o introduce job categories as in DRMAA, vendors can then chose to interpret 
  JSDL semantics depending on the job category. Does this undermine the 
  semantics of the JSDL?
o key issue is to provide a clear mapping for a core set of features.
o JSDL will provide independence of job submission platform.


o Can JSDL fill the gap in the agreement protocol, (OGSI-Agreement draft available).
