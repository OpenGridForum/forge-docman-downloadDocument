JSDL 1.1 issues
===============
- The group discusses the tracker artifacts available on GridForge
- artf5649 "CPU time elements"
  -- The group did not reach consensus on a resolution for this artifact.
  -- AI-12.13-a: Andreas to contact Chris Smith to clarify this artifact
- artf5648 "Disk space resources"
  -- The group discusses various alternatives of interpretation of the elements
     referenced in this artifact
  -- The group reaches consensus that for the DiskSpace element of the 
     FileSystem element, the alternative 2 was meant. Quota systems might 
     narrow the interpretation of this element to atch alternative 3. This, 
     however, is implementation-dependant.
  -- For IndividualDiskSpace, unconfigured (raw) local disk space is meant.
  -- AI-12.13-b: Andreas Savva to clarify this issue.
- artf5650 "IndividualNetworkBandwidth"
  -- The group reaches consensus that this should be interpreted as the rated 
     bandwidth of the interface.
  -- A final rework of this issue is expected to be done in JSDL 2.0
  -- AI-12.13-c: Darren to fix this issue
-

  -- The group needd to explore and make contact with existing parameter sweep 
     solutions
  -- Nimrod project may help out
     --- AI-12.13-d: Ali to make first contact with Nimrod
  -- AI-12.13-e: Andreas to set up a Wiki collecting technlogy that offers
                 parameter sweep technology
