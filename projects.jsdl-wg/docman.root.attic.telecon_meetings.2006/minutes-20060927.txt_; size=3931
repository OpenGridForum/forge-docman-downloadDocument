* Agenda has been agreed without changes
* Michel Drescher has been assigned note taker.


GGF18 report/review

* D Fellows & M Drescher on backwards compatibility
  - No progress
  - Chris Smith announces that he will contribute to the appropriate tracker
* A Savva on PalmPilot naming with CIM
  - No progress
* M Drescher on MointPoint issue
  - no progress
  - Interlinked with the backwards compatibility statement
* Other assignments could nor be reviewed as the relevant persons were not
  on the call

Reviiew of new drafts
=====================
* C Smith gives an overview on the HPC Profile Application Specification v1.0
* A Savva comments on OGF copyright and IPR statements
* A Savva comments on the Executable element
  - The definition states that the pathname is either relative or absolute
  - There is a footnote later in the text that gives ambiguous statements 
    regarding the Executable element
  - AI-0927a: C Smith: Resolve this issue, e.g. delete the footnote etc.
  - AI-0927b: A Savva: Do the same for the POSIXApplication extension in 
                       JSDL 1.0  
* The group discusses the Argumnt element definition
  - The definition is unclear, just as the definition in JSDL 1.0 is unclear.
  - The group has rough consesus that the type xsd:string is okay. In this case 
    the definition needs to be rewritten, i.e. remove the part "is a contrained
    normalized string [...] and MUST NOT collapsed."
  - AI-0927c: C Smith: Brush up the definition of the Argument element in 
                       relation to 
                       - what means "collapsed", empty elements
                       - combining consecutive Argument elements
                       - constrained normalized string
* The group discusses the issues around working directory, input, output, 
  error and executable elements
  - AI-0927d: C Smith: To clarify the document with respect to container 
                       behaviour for Input Output and Error and the current
                       workung directory (see Executable element definition)
* The group discusses the UserName element
  - A Savva proposes to follow the lead of the JSDL 1.1 approach having a 
    general Security Consideration section that refers back to differing 
    considerations given with the relevant element definition.
  - The group reaches consesus that the HPC Profile Application Element 
    definition should follow that approach.


Next call
