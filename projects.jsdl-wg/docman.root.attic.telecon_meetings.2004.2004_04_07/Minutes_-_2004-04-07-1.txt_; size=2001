JSDL 07.Apr.2004

o Presentation by Asit Dan -- See slides
  . WS-A template could be used to carry JSDL content
  . JSDL should not be WS-A specific, but should be able to use it
  . Time to start talking to WS-A since they're starting to solidify their goals
    - Joint meetings?
  . These meeting notes will be cross posted to WS-A.  (Hi, guys!)
  . Will share WS-A drafts with us before GGF11 o What is plan about reviewing spec and notes?
  . Resource description
    - JDL originally had plans for a resource description language
    - Ended up getting pushed out into other group/effort
    - How to do it without WS-A?
    - Very complex problem
    - Is resource select from WS-A interpreted by XML?
    - Passing in a freeform string is also pretty hideous
    - Also the issue of translation mapping for specific DRMs
    - Maybe use discrete resource definitions with a very small set of relational operations
      ~ 80/20 rule
    - Key issue
    - Any hope of a resource description language group?
      ~ None exists
      ~ We need some SMEs in that area
      ~ Should we form a new group, or is that the purpose of this group?
        < Can't really do it within the JSDL charter
    - JSDL onion model
      ~ Core
      ~ Resource description layer
        < Wanders into territory of business value
      ~ Security layer
      ~ File transfer layer
        < Close to core, but not quite core
      ~ Etc.
      ~ Scheduling should not in core
      ~ Core could be just job/application identification
        < What about job data files?
          > Close to core but not core
      ~ What about databases?
        < No idea
        < 2 aspects: DB for app itself & ???
      ~ Should draft as doc and put on mailing list
