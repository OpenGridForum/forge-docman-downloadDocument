  Apologies:
    Alexander Papaspyrou

* Agenda:

>    1. Agenda bashing & quick status update
     
     No additional topics

>    2. Activity instance document specification

    Andreas to review doc and accept changes; and apply a number of
    the changes agreed below

> DOCUMENT:
> - Clarification of terminology: activity versus activity
>   instance. The former is what the user/application/client/... wants
>   to have executed. The latter is generated according to this
>   specification. Check whole document for consistency. Introduce
>   terms.

    - Check for consistency and description of terms (andreas)
    - Delete glossary at the back (andreas)

> - Enumeration of figures (3 is missing).

  - Check and fix (andreas)
 
> - De-bold all references to references.

  - Appears to happen only in captions. Remove references from captions (andreas)

> - Do we provide Annex B (If not, adjust Section 3)

  - One for initial Activity instance entry and one with usage records and so on (philipp)

> - What was the decision re. Section 4? Fill or delete?

   - Delete (andreas) 

> - Is 5.10.6 example correct?

  - Change URI to tempuri.org   (andreas)

> - Adjust 6.2.5 to 6.1.5?

  - adjust the JSDL example to fit the UR (probably easier)
  - and adjust the UR example to make sense (e.g., recent date)

> - Insert missing references.

  (philipp)

> XSD:
> - Link to the OGF/W3C location of schemata, not the local ones.

   (philipp)

> - Take special care re UR URL!

   (philipp)

> - Check XSD versus specification.

  - Change the element names in the XSD for the ogf specs to match
    those used in the spec (philipp)


> - THEN add XSD to Annex A.

    - When the document is done (philipp)

- Other discussion

  - Fix the footer:  example@ggf.org -> jsdl-wg (andreas)

- UR section
  - history entry order cannot be relied on, it might be different from the UR
  - Need to reason based on  start / end fields of UR record

  Andreas to add some explanatory text to the spec 

  - recordId and LocalJobId could be used to check which system generated the UR

- Security section 

 - Could add signatures overall and/or on individual entries. Minor
   rewrite to describe both possibilities (andreas)

Next call: 2 weeks - June 2

>    3. Other business
>       - OGF29 sessions

  - Single session requested
