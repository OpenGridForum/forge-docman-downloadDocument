Agenda
------
	* Roll Call and Minutes
	* Approve last meetings minutes (I know we don't have a last meeting  
	  so this is a place holder for the future)
	* Agenda Bashing (in general, I will ask (not require) that anyone who  
	  wants to change the agenda please do so by email to me with at least  
	  24 hours notice on the actual meeting -- I'm a firm believer in  
	  Brooks' Mythical Man Month when it comes to meetings)
	* Teleconferencing Software
		- TokBox
		- Evo
	* JSDL Planning for 2011
		- What do we want to accomplish (I have a few ideas and I know that  
		  PGI has some thoughts)
		- How are we going to get from here to there.
		- What procedure will be adopt for prioritizing work
		- Who plans on active participation (i.e., who is going to work on  
		  JSDL items between telecons).
	* OGF 31 Discussion
	* Next Telecon Planning (Wednesday, 2 February 2011)
	* Action Item Review

* Planning
	* GLUE 2 and JSDL
		- Inside JSDL there is a part to describe the job itself
		- Another part describes service level agreement (or maybe it could
		  be there)
		- Describe pre-requisites which have to be matched for running job
			-- This part is related to the information system and which
			   we might like to be based on GLUE 2
	* JSDL-OR
		- JSDL requirements section where you specify what you require in order
		  to satisfy the job
			-- Want to be able to specify this OS, OR that OS
			-- This memory, or that cpu hours, etc.
	* Much Better SPMD for JSDL
		- Specify things like network topology
		- Shape support
		- A lot of these again refer to resources available
			-- Related to GLUE 2
				--- Dimensions of the shape, network topologies, etc.
	* JSDL 2
		- A couple of things are problems with JSDL 1
			-- Data staging credential part
				--- Need different credentials in data staging periods
				--- Client enabled data staging
				--- We were not sure how to render this as a profile
		
* GLUE 2 is the most important from the PGI perspective
	- Sergio says there has been no advancement with the Glue 2 spec.
		-- XML rendering is still not in shape
		-- Whether we can go on in the abstract
		-- Abstract specification does exist and we can work with this
		   abstract.  This is described in the draft document.
		-- Need a list of missing JSDL requirements attributes
			--- Etienne has already prepared a little
			--- He has listed attributes of classes and matched those with
				JSDL elements.  He's tried to match up.  Job is not complete.
* Backwards compatibility with JSDL 1.0

Action Items
------------
	* Mark Morgan to evaluate and prepare EVO for next telecon
	* Read the GLUE 2 document that Etienne has prepared
	* Start thinking about Use Cases
		-- Take an existing one
			--- Which existing one?
				> JSDL one?
					>> Mark to look up JSDL use case format and email out
					>> If you have another existing format, please email to
						group
	* Mark Morgan to get the JSDL minutes up and mailed out and to get the
	* Mark Morgan to look into task management

Decisions
---------
	* Try Evo for next week
	* Use existing use case format
	* Try and keep JSDL 1.0 and simply profile new section definitions.
