<p><strong>Charter for GGF Research Group on Particle and Nuclear Physics Applications
    (PNPA)</strong><br>
      <br>
  The Particle and Nuclear Physics Applications Research&nbsp;Group provides
  a forum for discussion of issues related to particle and nuclear physics applications
  and production grids. There are three specific goals, all with the overarching
  aim of ensuring that HENP actively participates in setting requirements and
  defining standards to ensure that its needs are met and to bring its experiences
in deploying and using large scale grids to the grid community as a whole. </p>
<ul>
  <li>To bring the requirements of the HENP community to the GGF in order to
    explain and inform the wider grid community of the specific needs and issues
    of HENP </li>
  <li>To ensure participation of the HENP community in grid standardization efforts,
    particularly in those areas and services essential to the successful use
    of grids in HENP. </li>
  <li>To provide early feedback to GGF technical working groups on the success
    or failure of various grid software components as used in high performance
    production activities by HENP experiments.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The particle and nuclear physics community has over the past few years provided
  the driving applications and made significant contributions to several projects
  (EDG, DataTAG, PPDG, GriPhyN, SiteAAA, iVDGL, Nordugrid) that have been actively
  involved in&nbsp;developing and deploying prototype, and now production, grid
  applications. Many of the participants in these projects are active participants
  or leaders of existing or new GGF working groups or research groups. Current
  areas of interest include security, high throughput data transport, data intensive
  management&nbsp;and access services, and information schema definition. As
  the community continues to develop and adopt higher level and more comprehensive
  services it is anticipated that we will contribute to other areas of work such
  as production and operations services, scheduling and job description, databases,
  frameworks and applications, and network and resource&nbsp; management.<br>
    <br>
  The PNPA Research Group will provide a venue to bring together domain application
  scientists together with the information technologists and researchers in grid
  technologies, at the leading forum for standards. HENP experiments are deploying
  petascale production grids now. We aim to identify the requirements of, and
  communicate experiences from, these deployments as they relate to the GGF.
  We believe there are important commonalities in requirements across the experiments
  in the field which can be collected and documented as a common set. </p>
<p> Members of this Research Group will include representatives of the LHC Computing
  Grid, Trillium, and other grid projects in the field. These projects must deliver
  and deploy production grid middleware and services to enable scientific analysis
  on a global scale. The research group will also ensure that grid developments
  driven by the larger projects within HENP will also be compatible and useable
  by other experiments within HENP. </p>
<p><strong>Scope:</strong></p>
<p>The scope of this research group will include the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Communicate areas of GGF work relevant to the community and vice versa.
    Propose mechanisms for the community to participate in existing, or propose
    new, working groups or research groups. </li>
  <li>Identify clear examples of the diverse use of the grid within the particle
    and nuclear physics community. This includes issues of access to, and archiving
    of, petascale datasets, services for virtual sub-organizations in a global
    community, and intelligent management of workflows and scheduling of a complex
    mix of petaop jobs needed by our community. </li>
  <li>Discuss state of standards, within the community and between the community
    and other application domains. </li>
  <li>Explore possible reference architectures for the community&rsquo;s distributed
    grid applications. </li>
  <li>Identify how the grid is being challenged by the particle and nuclear physics
    sciences, and communicate these requirements in the GGF forum. </li>
  <li>Promote issues related to production, operations and maintenance. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Action Items:<br>
</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Hold workshops at GGF meetings of varying length (from 1 hour to 1 day)
    and different focus areas related to the activities in the field, for communication
    and discussion of the ongoing program and plans of the community. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deliverables:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>An informational document that defines the requirements of the HENP community
    at this time from GGF WG and RGs - Initial draft Mar 2004. </li>
  <li>An initial informational document directed to grid designers and users
    in the HENP community summarizing GGF standards and recommended practices
    that could be adopted to HENP computing problems &ndash; Initial draft summer
    2004 </li>
  <li>An initial informational document (or series of documents) that relates
    the Application Area experiences to date to the goals and scope of the GGF &ndash; August
    2004. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Goals/Milestones:</strong></p>
